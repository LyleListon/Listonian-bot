Just some general things I've been thinking about:
Use the documentation database to store *all* learned information about the project.  Summarize every session and add it into the knowledge base with the indexes it needs.  

File structure needs to be checked at the beginning and end of every session to make sure needed files are there, and unneeded are not

Q&A session at the beginning of every session.  "Do you have any questions/concerns/suggestions?"

Setup the cline_docs as a persistent "memory" -- only what is needed to get the project working.  The knowledge base for everything else.

Every file that gets created needs documented fully.

Before you change something, take a moment to conside what else will change because of what you're about to do.

Before you fix an error, stop and think about all the reasons why that error could have  occurred.

Constantly looking for ways to make the project more profitable

 Make what's learned from the ML aspect visible  

ðŸ”¹ Oracle Manipulation Attack
ðŸ’¡ Example:

Flash loan large volume of an asset
Manipulate the price oracle by shifting liquidity
Use the new (incorrect) price to borrow more assets from a lending protocol
Withdraw funds & dump the manipulated asset
Repay flash loan and escape with stolen funds
âž¡ Why multi-step?
The first step sets up false market conditions, and the second step exploits it.

---Use Flashbots Protect RPC to track mempool movements.
Instead of comparing each pair one by one, batch your price fetches across multiple pools at once.
Implement parallel processing to scan different DEXs simultaneously.
Use custom price feeds instead of relying solely on chain oracles.
ðŸš€ Upgrade:

Use multi-threading or async I/O to check multiple markets in parallel.
