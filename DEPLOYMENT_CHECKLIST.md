## Pre-Deployment

1. Environment Variables
   - [ ] Set ALCHEMY_API_URL (from Alchemy dashboard)
   - [ ] Set WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY (from secure key storage)
   - [ ] Set ARBITRAGE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS (from contract deployment)
   - [ ] Set FLASHBOTS_AUTH_KEY (from Flashbots registration)
   - [ ] Set DASHBOARD_ORIGIN (production dashboard URL)

2. Contract Verification
   - [ ] Verify arbitrage contract on Etherscan
   - [ ] Test contract with small amounts
   - [ ] Verify contract ownership and permissions

3. Security Checks
   - [ ] Run security audit on final code
   - [ ] Verify all token addresses are checksummed
   - [ ] Test MEV protection
   - [ ] Verify slippage protection settings

4. System Requirements
   - [ ] Verify Python 3.12+ installation
   - [ ] Install all production dependencies
   - [ ] Set up log rotation
   - [ ] Configure system monitoring

## Deployment Steps

1. Initial Setup
   ```bash
   # Create and activate virtual environment
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
   
   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Configuration
   ```bash
   # Export environment variables
   export ALCHEMY_API_URL="your_alchemy_url"
   export WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY="your_private_key"
   export ARBITRAGE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS="your_contract_address"
   export FLASHBOTS_AUTH_KEY="your_flashbots_key"
   export DASHBOARD_ORIGIN="your_dashboard_url"
   ```

3. System Start
   ```bash
   # Start the production system
   python production.py
   ```

## Post-Deployment

1. Verification
   - [ ] Verify system connects to Ethereum network
   - [ ] Verify Flashbots integration
   - [ ] Verify flash loan functionality
   - [ ] Check logging is working
   - [ ] Monitor initial arbitrage attempts

2. Monitoring
   - [ ] Check system metrics

   Ctrl+C or send SIGTERM
   
   # Emergency shutdown
   Ctrl+\ or send SIGKILL
   ```

2. Recovery Steps
   - [ ] Check logs for errors
   - [ ] Verify contract state
   - [ ] Check account balances
   - [ ] Restart system if safe
