# DEX Discovery and Integration System
## Implementation Plan

## Problem Statement

The arbitrage bot is currently not detecting many opportunities for profitable trades due to insufficient DEX connections. Finding and configuring DEX contract addresses manually has proven difficult. This plan outlines an automated approach to discover, validate, and integrate DEX contracts on the Base network.

## Overview

We'll create a system that automatically discovers and integrates DEXes on the Base network, eliminating the need for manual contract address tracking. This will significantly increase the number of DEXes the bot can monitor, thereby increasing the likelihood of finding profitable arbitrage opportunities.

    end
    
    F --> A
    G --> A
    H --> A
    I --> A
```

## Phased Implementation Plan

To manage complexity and deliver value quickly, we'll implement the system in phases:

### Phase 1: Community-Maintained Lists & Basic Discovery (1-2 days)

## DEX Version Handling Strategy

### DEX Protocol Classification System

We'll implement a classification system that identifies and categorizes DEXes by their protocol type and version:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[DEX Protocol Classifier] --> B[UniswapV2-like]
    A --> C[UniswapV3-like]
    A --> D[Balancer-like]
    A --> E[Curve-like]
    A --> F[Custom/Other]
    
    B --> B1[BaseSwap V2]
    B --> B2[SushiSwap]
    
    C --> C1[Uniswap V3]
    C --> C2[BaseSwap V3]
    C --> C3[Aerodrome V3]
    
    D --> D1[Balancer V2]
    
    E --> E1[Curve Pools]
    
    F --> F1[Custom DEXes]
```

### Protocol-Specific Contract Detection

For each protocol type, we'll implement specialized detection logic:

#### UniswapV2-like DEXes
- **Factory Contract**: Identifies by `getPair(tokenA, tokenB)` function signature
- **Router Contract**: Identifies by `swapExactTokensForTokens()` function
- **Pair Contracts**: Identifies by `getReserves()` function
- **Fee Structure**: Typically fixed at 0.3% (30 bps)

#### UniswapV3-like DEXes
- **Factory Contract**: Identifies by `getPool(tokenA, tokenB, fee)` function signature
- **Router Contract**: Identifies by `exactInputSingle()` function
- **Pool Contracts**: Identifies by `slot0()` function
- **Fee Structure**: Multiple tiers (0.01%, 0.05%, 0.3%, 1%)

#### Balancer-like DEXes
- **Vault Contract**: Identifies by `swap()` function signature
- **Pool Registry**: Identifies by `getPool()` function
- **Pool Contracts**: Weighted, Stable, or Boosted pools
- **Fee Structure**: Configurable per pool

#### Curve-like DEXes
- **Factory Contract**: Identifies by `get_pool_from_lp_token()` function
- **Registry Contract**: Identifies by `get_n_coins()` function
- **Pool Contracts**: Identifies by `get_dy()` function
- **Fee Structure**: Typically very low (0.04%)

## Handling Custom and Unknown DEX Protocols

### Extensible Protocol Detection Framework

We'll implement an extensible framework that can adapt to new protocols:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Protocol Detection Engine] --> B[Known Protocol Detectors]
    A --> C[Signature-Based Detector]
    A --> D[Behavior-Based Detector]
    A --> E[Self-Learning Module]
    
    B --> B1[Uniswap Detector]
    B --> B2[Balancer Detector]
    B --> B3[Curve Detector]
    
    C --> C1[Function Signature Analysis]
    C --> C2[Event Signature Analysis]
    
    D --> D1[Interaction Pattern Analysis]
    D --> D2[State Change Analysis]
    
    E --> E1[Pattern Recognition]
    E --> E2[Protocol Classification]
    E --> E3[Feedback Loop]
```

### Generic Protocol Adapter

For unknown protocols, we'll implement a generic adapter that can work with minimal information:

```python
class GenericDEXAdapter:
    """Adapter for unknown DEX protocols."""
    
    async def analyze_contract(self, address: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Analyze contract to determine its capabilities."""
        # Detect common DEX patterns
        # Identify key functions
        # Map to internal representation
        
    async def create_interaction_model(self, analysis: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Create interaction model based on contract analysis."""
        # Map functions to standard operations
        # Determine price calculation method
        # Identify key parameters
```
