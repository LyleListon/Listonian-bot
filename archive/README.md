# Archive Directory

This directory contains archived versions of project components for reference. No files here are actively used in the project, but they are preserved for historical context and potential future reference.

## Structure

- `configs/` - Historical configuration files and settings
- `docs/` - Previous documentation versions
- `scripts/` - Legacy startup and utility scripts
- `src/` - Archived source code and implementations

## Purpose

This archive exists to:
1. Preserve historical implementations
2. Maintain reference material
3. Keep alternative approaches available
4. Document evolution of the system

## Usage

Files in this directory should be treated as read-only reference material. For active development, use the main project directories.
