## SwapBased V3 Integration Issues

### Current Problem
We're experiencing issues with the SwapBased V3 pool data retrieval in the dashboard. The main challenges are:

1. Token symbol parsing in pool key generation
2. Pool data retrieval using different function names compared to standard V3 pools

### Changes Made

1. Token Symbol Parsing Fix:
```python
# Updated token symbol lookup to handle case-insensitive address matching
token0_symbol = next((k for k, v in self.tokens.items() if v.lower() == token0.lower()), '')
token1_symbol = next((k for k, v in self.tokens.items() if v.lower() == token1.lower()), '')
```

2. Pool Data Retrieval Update:
```python
# Added SwapBased V3 specific pool data retrieval
if dex_name == 'swapbased':
    current_state = await pool_contract.functions.currentState().call()
    return {
        'sqrtPriceX96': current_state[0],
        'tick': current_state[1],
        'liquidity': current_state[2]
    }
```

### Next Steps for Investigation

1. Verify SwapBased V3 pool contract ABI matches our implementation
2. Monitor pool data retrieval logs for any errors
3. Consider implementing additional error handling for SwapBased specific edge cases
4. Add logging to track token symbol resolution process

### Technical Context

- SwapBased V3 uses different function names compared to standard Uniswap V3 pools
- Token addresses need case-insensitive comparison due to checksum differences
- Pool data structure follows similar pattern but with different function names
- Dashboard is running on localhost:9095 and successfully connecting to Base network

### For Next Assistant

1. Monitor the dashboard logs for any errors related to SwapBased V3 pools
2. Verify if the currentState() function returns data in expected format
3. Consider implementing fallback mechanisms for pool data retrieval
4. Add more comprehensive error handling for token symbol resolution

Remember to maintain async/await patterns and proper error handling as per project standards.
