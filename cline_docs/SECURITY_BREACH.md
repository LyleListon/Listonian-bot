# CRITICAL SECURITY BREACH REPORT

## Immediate Actions Required

1. IMMEDIATELY REVOKE access and transfer any remaining funds from the compromised wallet
2. Generate a new wallet with a new private key
3. NEVER store the new private key in any files that could be committed to git
4. Use ONLY .env files for sensitive information, and ensure they are in .gitignore
5. Scan git history for any other potential security breaches

## Compromised Files

The following files contained sensitive information:

1. `.env` - Contained actual private key
2. `main.py` - Exposed private key in arbitrage loop
3. `arbitrage_bot/core/web3/web3_manager.py` - Exposed private key handling
4. `aero/config.py` - Exposed private key configuration

## Security Improvements Needed

1. Environment Variables:
   - Use ONLY .env files for sensitive data
   - Never commit .env files
   - Use .env.template for structure only

2. Private Key Handling:
   - Never pass private keys as parameters
   - Use secure environment loading
   - Implement proper key management system

3. Git Security:
   - Implement pre-commit hooks to prevent sensitive data commits
   - Regular security audits of git history
   - Consider git-secrets or similar tools

4. Code Changes:
   - Remove all direct private key references
   - Implement proper secrets management
   - Use environment variables exclusively for sensitive data

## Prevention Measures

1. Add strong pre-commit hooks
2. Regular security audits
3. Developer training on security best practices
4. Automated scanning for sensitive information
5. Clear documentation on security protocols

## Future Security Recommendations

1. Consider using a hardware wallet for production
2. Implement multi-signature requirements
3. Use secret management services
4. Regular security audits
5. Automated monitoring for suspicious activities
