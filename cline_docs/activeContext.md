# Active Context

## Current Work
- Fixed token address checksumming across all DEX implementations
- Added proper support for BaseSwapV3 and PancakeSwap
- Improved error handling in quoter functions
- Optimized async performance monitoring
- Added proper task cleanup in background services
- Migrating from eventlet to asyncio for better async support
- Fixing SSL and WebSocket server issues

## Recent Changes
1. Task Management:
   - Added proper task cleanup in AlertSystem
   - Added proper task cleanup in BalanceManager
   - Improved shutdown handling
   - Fixed task destruction warnings

2. Token Address Handling:
   - Added Web3.to_checksum_address() calls consistently
   - Fixed WETH address handling in configs
   - Improved address validation in base classes

3. DEX Support:
   - Added BaseSwapV3 implementation
   - Added PancakeSwap implementation
   - Updated dex_manager.py to support new DEXes

4. Quoter Improvements:
   - Fixed quoteExactInputSingle handling
   - Added better error handling
   - Improved logging for quoter failures

5. Performance Optimization:
   - Added higher threshold for slow callback warnings
   - Made debug mode configurable via ENV
   - Improved async operation efficiency
   - Added proper task management

6. WebSocket and Memory Bank Updates:
   - Switched from eventlet to asyncio in WebSocket server
   - Updated memory bank to use asyncio locks
   - Fixed SSL initialization issues
   - Improved WebSocket connection handling

## Problems Encountered
1. Task Cleanup Issues:
   - Fixed by adding proper task tracking
   - Added shutdown event handling
   - Added task cancellation on shutdown
   - Added proper task cleanup

2. WETH Address Issues:
   - Fixed by ensuring consistent checksumming
   - Added WETH address to all DEX configs

3. Network Connectivity:
   - Fixed RPC URL configuration
   - Added proper error handling for network calls

4. Quoter Function Errors:
   - Fixed by properly handling return values
   - Added validation for quoter responses

5. Performance Warnings:
   - Addressed by configuring asyncio debug settings
   - Added higher threshold for slow operations
   - Improved task management

6. SSL/WebSocket Issues:
   - Fixed by properly ordering SSL patching
   - Switched to aiohttp for WebSocket server
   - Updated memory bank to use asyncio locks
   - Resolved SSL initialization conflicts

## Next Steps
1. Test new DEX implementations:
   - Verify BaseSwapV3 functionality
   - Verify PancakeSwap functionality
   - Test cross-DEX operations

2. Monitor Performance:
   - Watch for any remaining slow operations
   - Verify task cleanup is working
   - Optimize if needed

3. Documentation:
   - Update API documentation
   - Document new DEX implementations
   - Add configuration guides
   - Document task management patterns

4. Async Migration:
   - Continue migrating from eventlet to asyncio
   - Test WebSocket performance
   - Monitor memory bank async operations
   - Verify SSL/TLS handling
