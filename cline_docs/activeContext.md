# Active Development Context

## Current Focus: DEX Integration Framework

### Recently Completed
1. Implemented new DEX integration framework:
   - Created DEXRegistry for centralized DEX management
   - Developed base classes for V2 and V3 DEXes
   - Implemented PancakeSwap V3 and BaseSwap V2 as examples
   - Updated MarketAnalyzer to use new framework

2. Key Improvements:
   - Consistent path encoding for V3 DEXes
   - Unified quote handling
   - Better error handling and logging
   - Easy DEX addition/removal
   - Improved debugging capabilities

### Current State
1. Active Components:
   - DEX Registry operational
   - Base V2/V3 classes ready for use
   - Two example DEXes implemented
   - MarketAnalyzer using new framework

2. System Health:
   - All core functionality working
   - Improved error handling in place
   - Better monitoring capabilities

### Next Steps
1. Immediate Tasks:
   - Implement Aerodrome integration
   - Add SwapBased support
   - Integrate RocketSwap
   - Add DEX-specific health checks

2. Planned Improvements:
   - Implement multicall for batch quotes
   - Add performance benchmarking
   - Optimize gas usage
   - Enhance monitoring dashboard

3. Technical Debt:
   - Add comprehensive unit tests for DEX framework
   - Create integration test suite
   - Document DEX-specific configuration requirements

### Integration Notes
1. Adding New DEXes:
   - Use BaseV2DEX or BaseV3DEX as appropriate
   - Implement required interface methods
   - Add to DEX registry in MarketAnalyzer
   - Update configuration files

2. Configuration Requirements:
   - V2 DEXes need: router, factory, fee_numerator
   - V3 DEXes need: quoter, factory, fee_tiers
   - Optional: custom gas estimates, rate limits

3. Monitoring Considerations:
   - Each DEX reports its own metrics
   - Cross-DEX comparisons available
   - Error tracking per DEX

## Current Branch
- Branch: feature/dex-framework
- Status: Active development
- Dependencies: Web3Manager, ConfigLoader

## Recent Changes
1. Added new files:
   - dex_registry.py
   - base_dex_v2.py
   - base_dex_v3.py
   - pancakeswap_v3.py
   - baseswap_v2.py

2. Modified files:
   - market_analyzer.py (updated to use DEX registry)
   - config files (added DEX-specific settings)

## Known Issues
1. Rate limiting:
   - Some DEXes need custom rate limits
   - Backoff strategy might need tuning

2. Gas optimization:
   - V3 path encoding could be more efficient
   - Batch quotes not yet implemented

## Testing Status
1. Unit Tests:
   - Base classes tested
   - Example implementations tested
   - Registry functionality verified

2. Integration Tests:
   - Basic DEX interactions verified
   - Quote accuracy confirmed
   - Error handling tested

3. Needed Tests:
   - Cross-DEX arbitrage scenarios
   - Rate limit edge cases
   - Recovery scenarios

## Documentation Status
1. Updated:
   - systemPatterns.md
   - activeContext.md (this file)

2. Needs Update:
   - API documentation
   - Configuration guide
   - Deployment instructions
