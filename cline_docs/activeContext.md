# Active Context

## Current Work
IMPORTANT: We are migrating from eventlet to pure asyncio/async/await patterns.

### Migration Status
1. Completed Components:
   - Memory bank system (bank.py)
   - Market models (market_models.py)
   - Dashboard WebSocket server (minimal_dashboard.py)
   - Event loop management (eventlet_patch.py renamed to async_manager.py)

2. In Progress:
   - Analytics system (analytics_system.py)
   - DEX implementations
   - Web3 interactions
   - Event handling

3. Pending:
   - Background tasks
   - Monitoring systems
   - Performance tracking
   - Resource management

### Migration Strategy
1. Core Changes:
   - Remove all eventlet dependencies
   - Implement proper async/await patterns
   - Add thread safety mechanisms
   - Enhance resource management
   - Improve error handling

2. Implementation Approach:
   - Convert one component at a time
   - Maintain backward compatibility
   - Add comprehensive testing
   - Update documentation
   - Monitor performance

## Recent Changes

1. Async Implementation:
   - Converted memory bank to async/await
   - Updated market models to use async
   - Implemented async WebSocket server
   - Added proper thread safety
   - Enhanced resource management

2. Thread Safety:
   - Added initialization locks
   - Added contract access locks
   - Added cache access locks
   - Added resource locks
   - Added transaction nonce locks

3. Resource Management:
   - Added async initialization
   - Implemented proper cleanup
   - Added resource monitoring
   - Enhanced error recovery
   - Added performance tracking

4. Documentation:
   - Updated system patterns
   - Updated technical context
   - Added async implementation guides
   - Enhanced error handling docs
   - Added migration notes

## Problems Encountered

1. Async Migration Issues:
   - Fixed by implementing proper async patterns
   - Added proper error handling
   - Enhanced resource management
   - Improved task cleanup
   - Added proper initialization

2. Thread Safety Issues:
   - Fixed by adding proper locks
   - Implemented double-checked locking
   - Added resource protection
   - Enhanced state consistency
   - Improved concurrent access

3. Resource Management:
   - Fixed by adding proper initialization
   - Enhanced cleanup procedures
   - Added resource tracking
   - Improved error recovery
   - Added performance monitoring

## Next Steps

1. Continue Async Migration:
   - Convert analytics system
   - Update DEX implementations
   - Enhance Web3 interactions
   - Improve event handling
   - Add performance monitoring

2. Testing:
   - Test async implementations
   - Verify thread safety
   - Check resource management
   - Monitor performance
   - Validate error handling

3. Documentation:
   - Update remaining docs
   - Add migration guides
   - Document patterns
   - Add examples
   - Update troubleshooting

4. Performance:
   - Monitor async operations
   - Track lock contention
   - Measure resource usage
   - Analyze bottlenecks
   - Optimize critical paths

## Technical Notes

1. Async Implementation:
   - Using Python 3.12+ for improved async support
   - Pure asyncio/async/await patterns
   - No eventlet or gevent dependencies
   - Proper error handling
   - Resource management

2. Thread Safety:
   - Lock management for shared resources
   - Double-checked locking pattern
   - Resource protection
   - State consistency
   - Concurrent access control

3. Resource Management:
   - Async initialization
   - Proper cleanup
   - Resource monitoring
   - Error recovery
   - Performance tracking

4. Testing Requirements:
   - Async implementation tests
   - Thread safety verification
   - Resource management checks
   - Performance testing
   - Error recovery validation
