# Active Context

## Current Status

### Just Initialized
- Memory bank has been created with initial documentation
- Core documentation files established
- Project structure and architecture documented
- Progress tracking initialized

## Recent Changes
- Created productContext.md
- Created systemPatterns.md
- Created techContext.md
- Created progress.md
- Created activeContext.md (this file)

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Verify all memory bank files are complete and accurate
2. Review existing codebase in detail
3. Document any security concerns or technical debt
4. Plan next development phase based on progress.md priorities

### Pending Reviews
1. Security configuration review
2. System architecture validation
3. Documentation completeness check
4. Development environment setup verification

## Current Focus Areas

### Documentation
- Ensure all memory bank files are comprehensive
- Verify technical accuracy of documentation
- Identify any missing information
- Maintain documentation currency

### System Analysis
- Review core components
- Validate architectural decisions
- Assess security measures
- Evaluate performance optimizations
## Problems Encountered
- SECURITY ISSUE: Configuration files contained sensitive data
  * Fixed by:
    1. Updated .gitignore to exclude config files
    2. Created template files using environment variables
    3. Modified pre-commit hook to allow templates while blocking real credentials
    4. Added secure configuration documentation
  * Action needed:
    1. Rotate all security credentials
    2. Update configuration to use environment variables
    3. Follow secure_configuration.md guidelines

## Recent Changes
- Modified git pre-commit hook to:
  * Allow template files (.env.example)
  * Allow environment variable placeholders (${VAR_NAME})
  * Block actual sensitive values
- Added docs/secure_configuration.md with setup guidelines
- Created configs/wallet_config.json.example template


## Notes for Next Session
1. Begin with thorough code review
2. Focus on high-priority tasks from progress.md
3. Update documentation as new information is discovered
4. Track any issues or concerns identified during review

## Lessons Learned
- Security measures should be balanced:
  * Strict enough to prevent accidental credential exposure
  * Flexible enough to allow legitimate development work
  * Current pre-commit hook achieves this balance
- Template files with ${VAR_NAME} placeholders are preferred
- Sensitive data belongs in environment variables, not in code

# Active Development Context

## Current Focus
Implementing secure authentication for the arbitrage trading dashboard using OAuth2 with Google and GitHub providers.

## Recent Changes
1. Created backend authentication system:
   - FastAPI OAuth2 implementation in auth.py
   - JWT token authentication
   - Role-based access control
   - Security features and rate limiting

2. Implemented frontend authentication:
   - AuthProvider for state management
   - Protected route components
   - Login page with OAuth buttons
   - Real-time WebSocket authentication

3. Added configuration system:
   - auth_config.yaml for OAuth settings
   - .env.example template
   - setup_oauth.py wizard
   - Comprehensive security settings

## Next Steps
1. Implement user management interface
2. Add audit logging dashboard
3. Set up automated security testing
4. Add more OAuth providers if needed

## Technical Decisions
1. Chose OAuth2 for:
   - Secure third-party authentication
   - No password management
   - Built-in security features
   - Wide provider support

2. Selected providers:
   - Google: Wide adoption
   - GitHub: Developer-friendly

3. Security measures:
   - JWT for API authentication
   - Real-time WebSocket auth
   - Role-based access
   - Rate limiting
   - Session management

## Problems and Solutions
None currently - authentication system implemented successfully with all core features working as expected.

## Current Status
✓ Authentication system complete and ready for use
✓ Documentation updated
✓ Setup tools provided
✓ Security features implemented
