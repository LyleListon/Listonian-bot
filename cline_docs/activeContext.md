# Active Context

## Current System State
- Bot and dashboard are integrated components
- ArbitrageBot class in main.py handles both:
  - Core arbitrage functionality
  - Dashboard initialization via subprocess

## Current Focus
- Fixing market metrics collection in market_analyzer.py
- Issue: Response format mismatch between MCP tool and analyzer
- Status: Implementing format handling updates
- Impact: Affects price data processing for WETH and USDC

## Running the System
- Single entry point through production.py
- Dashboard auto-starts with bot
- Environment variables loaded from .env
- Logging configured for both bot and dashboard

## Component Status
1. Core Bot
   - Web3 connection established
   - DEX integrations initialized (PancakeSwap V3, BaseSwap)
   - Analytics system running
   - Alert system active

2. Dashboard
   - Running on http://localhost:5000
   - WebSocket server on port 8771
   - Real-time metrics display working
   - Graphs initialized

## Recent Changes
1. Core Improvements
   - Fixed PancakeSwap V3 slot0() decoding
   - Integrated real-time price data via crypto-price MCP server
   - Enhanced market validation using market analyzer
   - Streamlined trade execution flow

## Known Issues
1. Non-Critical Warnings
   - Market metrics initially empty (expected during startup)
   - Some ML warnings due to insufficient training data
   - Non-critical WebSocket connection retries

## Next Steps
1. Monitor arbitrage opportunity detection
2. Track execution success rate
3. Fine-tune market validation parameters
4. Optimize gas usage for higher profitability

## Important Notes
- All components initialized successfully
- WebSocket server properly configured
- Database connections established
- Real-time monitoring active
