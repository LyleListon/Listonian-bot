# Active Context

## Current Work Status

### Latest Deployment
- MultiPathArbitrage contract deployed to Base mainnet
- Contract Address: 0x72958f220B8e1CA9b016EAEa5EEC18dBFaAB84eb
- Transaction Hash: 0x8e2d8440bb76964afd0da1467e9eff694c3849287f518cfb4cbe2c00b3051fb6
- Pool Address Provider: 0xe20fCBdBfFC4Dd138cE8b2E6FBb6CB49777ad64D
- Deployer: 0x257a30645bF0C91BC155bd9C01BD722322050F7b

### Current Focus
- Fixing startup issues and making components async-compatible
- Resolving initialization sequence issues
- Making DEX components properly async
- Updating gas optimization system
- Improving error handling during startup

### System State
- Contract deployed and operational
- Owner set to deploying wallet
- Profit recipient initialized
- Currently fixing startup issues:
  - Added psutil package
  - Added is_enabled attribute to all DEX classes
  - Fixed string formatting in main.py
  - Fixed dashboard import issue
  - Made initialize method async in base_dex.py
  - Added is_enabled attribute to base_dex.py
  - Making gas optimizer methods async

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Complete Gas Optimizer Updates
   - Make _update_gas_prices async
   - Update all gas price fetching methods to be async
   - Test gas optimization during startup

2. Test Startup Sequence
   - Verify all components initialize properly
   - Test error handling in startup scripts
   - Validate async operation of all components
   - Check component dependencies and initialization order

3. Error Handling Improvements
   - Enhance error reporting during startup
   - Add more detailed logging
   - Improve error recovery mechanisms
   - Test error scenarios

### Short Term
1. Complete startup fixes
2. Document all changes made
3. Test full system startup
4. Update documentation based on changes

### Medium Term
1. Expand test coverage
2. Enhance error handling
3. Improve startup procedures
4. Optimize initialization process

## Technical Notes
- Contract uses OpenZeppelin's Ownable pattern
- Implements safe token transfer patterns
- Includes event emission for tracking
- Gas-optimized for Base network
- All DEX components now have is_enabled attribute
- Gas optimizer being updated to be fully async
- Using proper async/await patterns throughout codebase
