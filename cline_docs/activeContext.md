# Active Development Context

## Current Focus
Implementing secure authentication for the arbitrage trading dashboard using OAuth2 with Google and GitHub providers.

## Recent Changes
1. Created backend authentication system:
   - FastAPI OAuth2 implementation in auth.py
   - JWT token authentication
   - Role-based access control
   - Security features and rate limiting

2. Implemented frontend authentication:
   - AuthProvider for state management
   - Protected route components
   - Login page with OAuth buttons
   - Real-time WebSocket authentication

3. Added configuration system:
   - auth_config.yaml for OAuth settings
   - .env.example template
   - setup_oauth.py wizard
   - Comprehensive security settings

4. Security improvements:
   - Updated .gitignore to exclude config files
   - Created template files using environment variables
   - Modified pre-commit hook to allow templates while blocking real credentials
   - Added secure configuration documentation

## Next Steps
1. Implement user management interface
2. Add audit logging dashboard
3. Set up automated security testing
4. Add more OAuth providers if needed

## Technical Decisions
1. Chose OAuth2 for:
   - Secure third-party authentication
   - No password management
   - Built-in security features
   - Wide provider support

2. Selected providers:
   - Google: Wide adoption
   - GitHub: Developer-friendly

3. Security measures:
   - JWT for API authentication
   - Real-time WebSocket auth
   - Role-based access
   - Rate limiting
   - Session management

## Problems and Solutions
None currently - authentication system implemented successfully with all core features working as expected.

## Current Status
✓ Authentication system complete and ready for use
✓ Documentation updated
✓ Setup tools provided
✓ Security features implemented

## Notes for Next Session
1. Begin with thorough code review
2. Focus on high-priority tasks from progress.md
3. Update documentation as new information is discovered
4. Track any issues or concerns identified during review

## Lessons Learned
- Security measures should be balanced:
  * Strict enough to prevent accidental credential exposure
  * Flexible enough to allow legitimate development work
  * Current pre-commit hook achieves this balance
- Template files with ${VAR_NAME} placeholders are preferred
- Sensitive data belongs in environment variables, not in code
