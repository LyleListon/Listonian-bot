# Active Context

## Current System State
- Bot is running successfully with core functionality
- Web3 connection established to Base mainnet
- DEX integrations active:
  - BaseSwap initialized
  - PancakeSwap V3 initialized
- Price monitoring active for WETH and USDC

## Current Focus
- Addressing non-critical issues:
  1. Aerodrome pool liquidity errors
     - Market analyzer failing to fetch liquidity data
     - Error appears non-blocking for core functionality
  2. ML system warnings
     - Insufficient training data reported
     - System continues to operate with default parameters
  3. Market metrics collection
     - Price data successfully updating
     - Volume and liquidity metrics need refinement

## Running the System

### Prerequisites
1. Python 3.9+ installed
2. Required environment files:
   - .env.production (contains API keys and wallet settings)
   - configs/production_config.json (contains trading parameters)
3. Package installed in development mode:
   ```
   pip install -e .
   ```

### Production Mode (Recommended)
1. Double-click `start_bot.bat`
   - This will start both the bot and dashboard
   - Automatically loads production environment
   - Creates separate windows for bot and dashboard

### Development Mode
1. Start the bot:
   ```
   python production.py
   ```
2. Start the dashboard separately:
   ```
   python -m arbitrage_bot.dashboard.run
   ```

### Access Points
- Bot logs: Check terminal output or logs/production.log
- Dashboard: http://localhost:5000
- WebSocket: Port 8771

## Component Status
1. Core Bot
   - Web3 connection: Active (Chain ID: 8453)

   - DEX integrations: BaseSwap and PancakeSwap V3 operational
   - Analytics system: Running with basic metrics
   - Alert system: Active and monitoring

2. Dashboard
   - Web interface: http://localhost:5000
   - WebSocket server: Port 8771
   - Real-time updates: Active
   - Performance metrics: Updating regularly

## Recent Changes
1. System Improvements
   - Package installed in development mode
   - Environment variables properly configured
