# Next Steps for Arbitrage Bot Development

## Current Status
We have enhanced the SwapBased V3 integration with:

1. Router-Based Quote System:
   - Implemented getAmountsOut for quotes
   - Added multi-tier fee support
   - Enhanced error handling
   - Improved token decimal handling

2. Core Improvements:
   - Router contract integration
   - Fallback mechanisms
   - Enhanced error recovery
   - Quote validation system

## Next Phase: Optimization & Scaling

### 1. Quote System Enhancement
- Quote Caching
  * Implement caching layer
  * Set appropriate TTL
  * Handle cache invalidation
  * Monitor hit rates

- Pool Discovery
  * Optimize pool lookup
  * Cache known pools
  * Smart fee tier selection
  * Reduce RPC calls

- Error Recovery
  * Enhance fallback system
  * Improve error classification
  * Add detailed logging
  * Monitor recovery rates

### 2. Performance Optimization

#### Gas Optimization
- Batch Operations
  * Group similar operations
  * Use multicall where possible
  * Optimize contract calls
  * Monitor gas usage

- Memory Management
  * Implement quote cache
