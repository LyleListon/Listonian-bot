# Project Progress

## Current Status
Dashboard running with optimized DEX configuration. Core DEXes (BaseSwap, SwapBased, PancakeSwap) operational.

## Completed Work

### Core Infrastructure
1. **Dashboard Architecture**
   - Proper component separation in arbitrage_bot/dashboard/
   - Integration with market_analyzer for data handling
   - WebSocket server for real-time updates
   - Mock data support through MCP client

2. **Data Flow**
   - MCP client providing development data
   - Market analyzer processing market data
   - Web3Manager handling blockchain interactions
   - Real-time updates via WebSocket

3. **System Integration**
   - Component initialization order established
   - Error handling patterns implemented
   - Mock data patterns for development
   - System monitoring working

4. **DEX Integration**
   - DEX factory pattern implemented
   - Configuration-based DEX management
   - Selective DEX initialization
   - Error recovery mechanisms
   - Removed unused DEXes (Sushiswap)

### Integration
1. **Component Integration**
   - MCP servers properly connected
