## Current Status

The arbitrage system is now fully functional and ready for production deployment with complete monitoring capabilities. All core components have been implemented and tested, with comprehensive documentation provided for configuration and usage.

The system is capable of:
1. Dynamically adjusting trade sizes based on available balance
2. Finding profitable arbitrage paths across multiple DEXs
3. Protecting transactions from MEV attacks
4. Ensuring trades remain profitable despite slippage
5. Providing real-time system monitoring through a web dashboard

The implementation satisfies all initial requirements and includes additional features for safety, adaptability, and operational visibility. The system is ready to be deployed and operated, with further enhancements planned for future releases.
