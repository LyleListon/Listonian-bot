# Secure Configuration Guide

## CRITICAL: Immediate Actions Required

1. **TRANSFER FUNDS IMMEDIATELY**
   - Transfer any remaining funds from the compromised wallet to a new secure wallet
   - Generate a new wallet using a hardware wallet or secure offline process
   - Never store the new private key in any files or git repositories

2. **Secure Environment Setup**

   ```bash
   # 1. Create a new .env file (NEVER commit this)
   NETWORK_RPC_URL=your_rpc_url
   WALLET_ADDRESS=your_new_wallet_address
   # Store private key in secure hardware wallet or encrypted storage
   
   # 2. Use secure_env.py to encrypt sensitive data
   python -m arbitrage_bot.utils.secure_env
   ```

3. **Security Measures**

   - Private keys should NEVER be stored in:
     - Git repositories
     - Plain text files
     - Environment variables (use secure encrypted storage)
     - Configuration files
   
   - Use hardware wallets or secure key management systems
   - Implement multi-signature requirements for production
   - Regular security audits and monitoring

## Secure Configuration Process

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Use .env.template for structure
   - Keep actual .env file local and secure
   - Use secure_env.py for encrypting sensitive data

2. **Wallet Security**
   - Use hardware wallets for production
   - Multi-signature setup for high-value operations
   - Regular rotation of hot wallet keys
   - Limited funds in hot wallets

3. **Access Control**
   - Role-based access control
   - Separate development/production environments
   - Audit logging of all sensitive operations
   - Regular security reviews

## Development Guidelines

1. **Never store sensitive data in:**
   - Source code
   - Git repositories
   - Plain text files
   - Logs or debug output

2. **Always use:**
   - Encrypted storage for keys
   - Hardware wallets when possible
   - Secure key management systems
   - Access logging and monitoring

3. **Code Review Requirements**
   - Security review for all changes
   - Automated scanning for sensitive data
   - Regular security audits
   - Dependency vulnerability checks

## Production Deployment

1. **Key Management**
   - Hardware security modules (HSM)
   - Multi-signature wallets
   - Regular key rotation
   - Access control and monitoring

2. **Monitoring**
   - Real-time security monitoring
   - Automated alerts for suspicious activity
   - Regular security audits
   - Incident response plan

3. **Backup and Recovery**
   - Secure backup procedures
   - Disaster recovery plan
   - Regular testing of recovery procedures
   - Documentation of all processes

## Security Checklist

## Emergency Contacts

Maintain a list of emergency contacts for security incidents:
- Security team lead
- System administrators
- Key stakeholders
- Legal team

## Regular Security Reviews

Schedule regular security reviews:
- Weekly automated scans
- Monthly manual reviews
- Quarterly penetration testing
- Annual comprehensive audit
