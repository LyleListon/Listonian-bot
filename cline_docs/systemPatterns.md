# System Architecture Patterns

## Core Components

### DEX Layer
- Base DEX interfaces (V2/V3)
- Protocol-specific implementations
- Shared utilities for common operations
- Factory pattern for DEX creation
- Manager pattern for DEX lifecycle

### Analytics Layer
- Real-time metrics collection
- Historical data analysis
- Performance tracking
- Risk metrics calculation

### ML Layer
- Predictive models
- Feature engineering
- Model training pipeline
- Real-time predictions

### Monitoring Layer
- Mempool monitoring
- Block monitoring
- Competitor analysis
- Network health checks

### Risk Management Layer
- Position sizing
- Portfolio balancing
- Risk metrics
- Trade approval system

## Design Patterns

### Factory Pattern
Used for creating DEX instances with appropriate configuration:
- DEXFactory for creating protocol-specific implementations
- Ensures consistent initialization
- Handles configuration validation

### Strategy Pattern
Applied to different trading strategies and execution methods:
- Separate algorithms from core logic
- Easily swap strategies at runtime
- Support for multiple execution paths

### Observer Pattern
Used for monitoring and event handling:
- Real-time updates across components
- Decoupled event handling
- Asynchronous notifications

### Repository Pattern
Applied to data storage and retrieval:
- Abstracted data access
- Consistent interface
- Caching support

## Communication Patterns

### Async/Await
- All network operations
- Database operations
- Long-running calculations

### Event-Driven
- Market updates
- Trade execution
- Balance changes
- Risk alerts

### Message Queue
- Transaction processing
- Analytics updates
- ML predictions

## Error Handling

### Circuit Breaker
- Network issues
- Market conditions
- Risk thresholds

### Retry Pattern
- Failed transactions
- Network timeouts
- Service unavailability

### Fallback Pattern
- Alternative DEXs
- Backup price feeds
- Secondary execution paths

## Performance Patterns

### Caching
- DEX data
- Market conditions
- ML predictions
- Gas estimates

### Batching
- Transaction bundling
- Data aggregation
- Balance updates

### Pooling
- Connection pools
- Worker pools
- Resource management

## Security Patterns

### Rate Limiting
- API calls
- Transaction submissions
- Network requests

### Validation Chain
- Input validation
- Transaction validation
- Output validation

### Access Control
- Role-based access
- Action authorization
- Resource permissions
