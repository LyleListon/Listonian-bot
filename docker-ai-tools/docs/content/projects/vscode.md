# Background

We worked on a VSCode extension to add a new Docker Language Service. The language sevice is IDE agnostic and can be attached to IDEs like Intellij, and neovim.

The [current extension releases](https://github.com/docker/docker-vscode-extension/releases) are available internally to Docker employees.
