In Node.js, you can access command line arguments via the process.argv array. This will contain the complete command-line.

Here is a simple program that reads a JavaScript string from the first command line argument and then evaluates it.

```javascript
// current file name will occupy the 0th index, followed by file name (or execution command e.g "node") on 1st index  and user supplied argument from 2nd index onwards
const args = process.argv.slice(2); 

if(args.length == 0) {
    console.log("Please provide javascript command as argument.");
    process.exit();
}

try {
    let result = eval(args[0]);
    console.log(result);
} catch(e) {
    console.error("Error in executing provided javascript command:", e.message);
}
```

To use this script, you need to write the JavaScript string as a command line argument.

```shell
node evalScript.js "console.log('Hello, world!')"
```

Note: Using eval() function can be dangerous because it executes the code it's given with the privileges of the caller. Even, it can be harmful when used with user-provided input, leading to potential code injection vulnerabilities. Be cautious while using eval().
