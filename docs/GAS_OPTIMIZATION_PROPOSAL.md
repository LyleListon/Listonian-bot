# Gas Optimization System Proposal

## Overview
A comprehensive system for tracking, analyzing, and optimizing gas usage across all operations.

## Data Collection

### Gas Transaction Data
```sql
CREATE TABLE gas_transactions (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    timestamp DATETIME,
    block_number INTEGER,
    dex_name TEXT,
    operation_type TEXT,  -- 'swap', 'approve', 'flash_loan', etc.
    gas_used INTEGER,
    gas_price INTEGER,
    base_fee INTEGER,
    priority_fee INTEGER,
    total_cost_wei INTEGER,
    success BOOLEAN,
    error_message TEXT,
    network_congestion_level FLOAT  -- 0-1 scale
);
```

### DEX-Specific Metrics
```sql
CREATE TABLE dex_gas_metrics (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    dex_name TEXT,
    timestamp DATETIME,
    avg_gas_used INTEGER,
    min_gas_used INTEGER,
    max_gas_used INTEGER,
    operation_type TEXT,
    success_rate FLOAT,
    sample_size INTEGER
);
```

### Time-Based Analysis
```sql
CREATE TABLE gas_time_patterns (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    hour_of_day INTEGER,  -- 0-23
    day_of_week INTEGER,  -- 0-6
    avg_gas_price INTEGER,
    avg_congestion FLOAT,
    success_rate FLOAT,
    total_transactions INTEGER,
    last_updated DATETIME
);
```

## Key Features

1. Dynamic Gas Limits
   - Track gas usage per DEX and operation type
   - Calculate optimal limits based on historical success rates
   - Adjust limits based on network conditions
   - Store successful transaction patterns

2. Smart Price Optimization
   - Weighted historical analysis (recent blocks count more)
   - Network congestion-based buffer adjustment
   - Priority fee optimization for Base chain
   - Time-based price predictions

3. DEX Efficiency Analysis
   - Gas efficiency rankings per DEX
   - Success rate tracking
   - Cost-benefit analysis for different operation types
   - Automatic threshold adjustments

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Data Collection
1. Implement database schema
2. Add logging for all gas-related operations
3. Begin collecting historical data
4. Set up basic monitoring

### Phase 2: Analysis
1. Develop analysis algorithms
2. Create gas usage patterns
3. Identify optimal trading windows
4. Generate DEX efficiency metrics

### Phase 3: Optimization
