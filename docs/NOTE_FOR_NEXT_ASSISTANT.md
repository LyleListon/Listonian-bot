## Changes Made to the Arbitrage Bot

### 1. Configuration Updates

We've updated the following configuration files to optimize the arbitrage bot:

#### configs/production.json
- Added DEX configurations for BaseSwap, PancakeSwap V3, Aerodrome, and SushiSwap
- Updated path_finder settings to increase max_path_length to 4 and max_parallel_requests to 15
- Added preferred_intermediate_tokens for optimized path finding
- Updated scan settings to increase max_paths to 4 and added path_diversity_weight
- Updated performance settings to increase max_concurrent_paths to 15
- Added path_optimization_level and path_diversity_weight to performance settings
- Updated flash_loan settings with preferred tokens and max_pool_usage_percent

#### configs/config.json
- Fixed Aerodrome configuration by:
  - Setting the correct factory address
  - Adding the WETH-USDC pool address
  - Setting enabled to false to prevent errors
  - Removing the aerodrome_v3 configuration that was causing errors

### 2. Current Bot Status

- The bot is running with multiple Python processes
- The bot is successfully fetching quotes from Aerodrome V2 and BaseSwap
- The bot is in the "Initializing" state according to the dashboard
- The bot is not detecting any arbitrage opportunities yet ("Detected 0 raw opportunities before profit filtering")
- There are no errors in the logs related to the DEX configurations

### 3. Next Steps

- Monitor the bot for any arbitrage opportunities
- Consider adding more DEXes or token pairs if needed
- Optimize the min_profit_threshold if needed
- Consider increasing the logging level to get more detailed information about the price differences between DEXes

### 4. Potential Issues

- The bot might need more time to detect arbitrage opportunities
- The current market conditions might not have any profitable arbitrage opportunities
- The min_profit_threshold might be set too high
- The bot might need additional DEXes or token pairs to find profitable opportunities
