   - Storage and retrieval of DEX information

2. [Flashbots Integration](FLASHBOTS_INTEGRATION.md)
   - Private transaction routing
   - Bundle submission for atomic execution
   - MEV protection against front-running and sandwich attacks
   - Flash loan integration with Balancer

3. [Multi-Path Arbitrage](multi_path_arbitrage.md)
   - Advanced path finding with Bellman-Ford algorithm
   - Capital allocation with Kelly criterion
   - Risk management and position sizing
   - Parallel execution of multiple paths

4. [Real-Time Metrics](real_time_metrics_optimization.md)
   - Task management for async operations
   - Connection management with state machine
   - Metrics batching and throttling
   - Resource cleanup and monitoring

5. [Performance Optimization](performance_optimization.md)
   - Shared memory for efficient data sharing
   - WebSocket optimization with binary format
   - Resource management for memory, CPU, and I/O
   - Message batching and compression

6. [Advanced Analytics](advanced_analytics.md)
   - Profit tracking and attribution
   - Trading journal with insights
   - Alert system for opportunities and risks
   - Performance analysis and visualization
