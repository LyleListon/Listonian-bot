# Listonian Arbitrage Bot: System Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Listonian Arbitrage Bot system architecture, components, and how they interact to discover and execute profitable arbitrage opportunities.

## System Architecture

The Listonian Arbitrage Bot is built with a modular architecture that separates concerns and allows for independent development and testing of components. The system follows these architectural principles:

1. **Modularity**: Each component has a well-defined responsibility
2. **Asynchronous Design**: All operations use async/await patterns
3. **Resource Management**: Proper initialization and cleanup
4. **Thread Safety**: Locks and atomic operations for concurrent access
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with context preservation

## Core Components

### 1. DEX Discovery System

The DEX Discovery System is responsible for finding and validating DEXes across multiple sources.

**Key Components:**
- `DEXDiscoveryManager`: Coordinates the discovery process

- Source Implementations:
  - `DefiLlamaSource`: Discovers DEXes from DeFiLlama
  - `DexScreenerSource`: Discovers DEXes from DexScreener
  - `DefiPulseSource`: Discovers DEXes from DefiPulse

**Flow:**
1. Discovery manager queries sources for DEXes
2. Sources return DEX information
3. Validator checks DEX contracts and functions
4. Repository stores validated DEXes
5. Discovery manager provides DEXes to other components
