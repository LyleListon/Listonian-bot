# System Architecture Overview

## Introduction
The arbitrage bot system is designed to identify and execute profitable trading opportunities across multiple decentralized exchanges (DEXes) on the Base network. The system is built with modularity, reliability, and performance in mind.

## System Components

### Core Layer
```
src/core/
├── blockchain/  # Blockchain interactions
├── dex/        # DEX integrations
├── models/     # Data structures
└── utils/      # Shared utilities
```

The core layer handles fundamental operations:
- Blockchain interaction and transaction management
- DEX integration and price monitoring
- Data modeling and validation
- Utility functions and helpers

### Application Layer
```
src/
├── dashboard/   # Web interface
├── monitoring/  # System monitoring
└── scripts/    # Entry points
```

The application layer provides:
- Real-time monitoring dashboard
- System health tracking
- Performance metrics
- Command-line interfaces
