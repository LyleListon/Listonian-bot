- Improved transaction building and validation

### 3. Dashboard Simplification

- Removed the outdated `arbitrage_bot/dashboard` directory
- Created a new, more modular dashboard in `new_dashboard/`
- Simplified the dashboard architecture
- Improved real-time data updates via WebSocket
- Enhanced visualization of arbitrage opportunities

### 4. Code Quality Improvements

- Fixed type annotations throughout the codebase
- Standardized error handling patterns
- Improved async/await usage for better performance
- Removed duplicate code and consolidated similar functionality
- Enhanced logging for better debugging
- Fixed parameter naming in Transaction TypedDict usage

### 5. Documentation Enhancements

- Created comprehensive README files for all major components:
  - Main project README
  - Core module README
  - DEX integration README
  - Integration module README
  - Testing framework README
  - Dashboard README
- Added code comments for complex sections
- Improved function and class docstrings
- Created usage examples for key components

### 6. Testing Improvements

- Fixed failing tests in the test suite
- Enhanced test fixtures for better reusability
- Improved mock objects for more accurate testing
- Added tests for previously untested components
- Fixed parameter issues in test functions

## Technical Details

### WebSocket Improvements

The WebSocket handling was refactored to use a more robust connection management approach:

```python
class WebSocketManager:
    """Manages WebSocket connections with automatic reconnection."""
    
    def __init__(self, url, reconnect_interval=5):
        self.url = url
        self.reconnect_interval = reconnect_interval
        self.ws = None
        self._connect_lock = asyncio.Lock()
        self._is_connected = False
        
    async def connect(self):
        """Connect to the WebSocket server with automatic reconnection."""
        async with self._connect_lock:
            if self._is_connected:
                return
                
            try:
                self.ws = await websockets.connect(self.url)
                self._is_connected = True
                asyncio.create_task(self._keep_alive())
            except Exception as e:
                logger.error(f"Failed to connect to WebSocket: {e}")
                asyncio.create_task(self._reconnect())
```

### Flash Loan Management

The flash loan functionality was consolidated into a unified manager:

```python
class UnifiedFlashLoanManager:
    """Unified manager for flash loan operations."""
    
    def __init__(self, web3, flashbots_provider, memory_bank, min_profit_threshold, max_slippage, max_paths):
        self.web3 = web3
        self.flashbots_provider = flashbots_provider
        self.memory_bank = memory_bank
        self.min_profit_threshold = min_profit_threshold
        self.max_slippage = max_slippage
        self.max_paths = max_paths
        
    async def prepare_flash_loan_bundle(self, token_pair, amount, prices):
        """Prepare a flash loan bundle for execution."""
        # Implementation
        
    async def execute_bundle(self, bundle):
        """Execute a prepared flash loan bundle."""
        # Implementation
```

### Testing Fixes

Several key issues were fixed in the test suite:

1. Fixed the `Transaction` constructor parameter names to match the TypedDict definition:
   - Changed `from_address` to `from_`
   - Changed `to_address` to `to`
   - Changed `gas_price` to `gas_price`

2. Fixed async fixture issues:
   - Used `@pytest_asyncio.fixture` for async fixtures
   - Changed `yield` to `return` in async fixtures

3. Fixed mock object issues:
   - Explicitly set `name` attributes on mock DEX objects
   - Added missing attributes to mock objects

## Next Steps

While significant progress has been made, there are still areas that could benefit from further improvement:

1. **Performance Optimization**: Further optimize the arbitrage path finding algorithm
2. **Additional DEX Support**: Add support for more DEXes
3. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Improve the monitoring and alerting system
4. **Gas Optimization**: Implement more sophisticated gas optimization strategies
5. **Multi-chain Support**: Extend the bot to support multiple blockchains

## Conclusion

The refactoring has significantly improved the code quality, stability, and maintainability of the Listonian Arbitrage Bot. The bot is now more robust, easier to understand, and better documented, making it easier for developers to work with and extend.
