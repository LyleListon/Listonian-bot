## Project Overview

The Listonian Arbitrage Bot is a sophisticated cryptocurrency arbitrage system designed to identify and execute profitable trading opportunities across decentralized exchanges (DEXs). The system leverages flash loans, MEV protection, and multi-path arbitrage to maximize profits while ensuring transaction security.

## Core Goals

1. **Maximize Arbitrage Profits** - Identify and execute profitable trading opportunities across multiple DEXs with minimal risk
2. **Ensure Transaction Security** - Protect arbitrage transactions from MEV attacks like front-running and sandwich attacks
3. **Optimize Capital Efficiency** - Utilize flash loans to execute arbitrage without requiring significant capital
4. **Provide Real-time Monitoring** - Deliver comprehensive dashboards for monitoring arbitrage opportunities and system performance
5. **Support Multiple DEXs** - Seamlessly integrate with various DEX protocols across different blockchains

    "productContext.md": """# Listonian Arbitrage Bot - Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

The Listonian Arbitrage Bot exists to capitalize on price inefficiencies across decentralized exchanges (DEXs). In the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, the same tokens often trade at slightly different prices on different exchanges. These price differences create arbitrage opportunities that can be exploited for profit.

## Problems It Solves

1. **Capital Efficiency Challenges** - Leverages flash loans to execute arbitrage without requiring substantial capital upfront
2. **MEV and Front-Running** - Integration with Flashbots provides protection against front-running and sandwich attacks
3. **Complex Path Finding** - Efficiently discovers optimal arbitrage paths across multiple DEXs
4. **Risk Management** - Multiple validation layers, transaction simulation, and slippage protection
5. **Monitoring and Analysis** - Comprehensive dashboards for real-time monitoring and analysis

## System Architecture

The Listonian Arbitrage Bot employs a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns. The system is structured around core components that interact through well-defined interfaces, allowing for flexibility and maintainability.

## Core Design Patterns

1. **Inheritance Hierarchy for DEX Implementation** - Layered inheritance for code reuse while accommodating protocol-specific differences
2. **Factory Pattern for Managers** - Manager instances created using factory functions to encapsulate initialization complexity
3. **Resource Management Pattern** - Proper initialization and cleanup using async context managers
4. **Adapter Pattern for Blockchain Integration** - Web3 connections abstracted through adapter classes
5. **Strategy Pattern for Arbitrage Execution** - Different execution strategies implemented using the strategy pattern

## Current Focus

The current development focus is on refactoring and improving the codebase to enhance maintainability, reliability, and performance. Based on a recent code review, several key areas have been identified for immediate attention:

1. **Flash Loan Manager Consolidation** - Consolidate FlashLoanManager and AsyncFlashLoanManager into a unified class
2. **Balance Management Refactoring** - Eliminate duplication between BalanceAllocator and BalanceManager
3. **Code Organization Improvements** - Split large classes like ArbitrageMonitor into smaller components
4. **Dead Code Removal** - Eliminate unused methods and imports throughout the codebase
5. **Naming Convention Enhancements** - Improve clarity and consistency in naming
6. **Documentation Addition** - Add thorough documentation at all levels
7. **Test Implementation** - Implement comprehensive testing for all components
8. **Initialization Pattern Standardization** - Standardize factory patterns for creating instances
