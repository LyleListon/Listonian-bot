   ```
   .\start_new_dashboard.bat
   ```

2. Open the dashboard in your browser:
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:8080`
   - Verify connection status in the top right

3. Dashboard Sections:
   - **Overview**: System status, wallet balance, and profit summary
   - **Opportunities**: Current arbitrage opportunities
   - **DEX Prices**: Price comparison across DEXes
   - **Trade Panel**: Controls for manual trade execution
   - **Gas Settings**: Gas optimization controls
   - **Analytics**: Historical performance data

4. Key Dashboard Indicators:
   - **Wallet Balance**: Current ETH balance
   - **Total Profit**: Accumulated profit
   - **Success Rate**: Percentage of successful trades
   - **Gas Prices**: Current network gas conditions
   - **MEV Protection Status**: Status of Flashbots integration

## Identifying Profitable Opportunities

### Using the Opportunity Scanner

1. Navigate to the "Opportunities" tab in the dashboard.

2. Scan Parameters:
   - **Profit Threshold**: Filter by minimum expected profit
   - **Max Path Length**: Maximum number of hops in the path
   - **Token Filter**: Focus on specific tokens
   - **DEX Filter**: Include/exclude specific DEXes

3. Sort opportunities by:
   - **Expected Profit**: Highest profit first
   - **ROI**: Return on investment percentage
   - **Gas Efficiency**: Profit per gas unit
   - **Success Probability**: Estimated chance of success

### Understanding Opportunity Types

1. **Simple Arbitrage**: Direct A→B→A paths
   - Lower complexity
   - Higher success rate
   - Typically smaller profits

2. **Multi-Path Arbitrage**: Complex paths with multiple hops
   - Higher complexity
   - Potentially larger profits
   - More sensitive to gas costs

3. **Flash Loan Opportunities**: Trades requiring borrowed capital
   - No capital requirements
   - Flash loan fees apply
   - Higher profit threshold needed

4. **Cross-DEX Opportunities**: Price discrepancies between different DEXes
   - Often most profitable
   - Varies by token pairs
   - Consider DEX-specific slippage models

## Analyzing Arbitrage Paths

Before executing a trade, analyze the opportunity details:

1. Click "Analyze" on a promising opportunity to see:
   - **Detailed Path**: All tokens and DEXes in the path
   - **Simulated Execution**: Expected outcome simulation
   - **Price Impact**: Estimated price changes from trade
   - **Slippage Analysis**: Potential slippage at each step
   - **Gas Breakdown**: Estimated gas costs by operation

2. Key Metrics to Evaluate:
   - **Net Profit**: Profit after all fees and gas costs
   - **Expected Slippage**: Predicted price movement
   - **Gas Cost Estimates**: Total gas required
   - **Risk Assessment**: MEV vulnerability analysis

3. Risk Indicators:
   - **Low Liquidity Warning**: Flags for thin liquidity pools
   - **High Volatility Warning**: Tokens with rapid price movement
   - **MEV Risk Score**: Potential for front-running or sandwich attacks
   - **Execution Confidence**: Statistical confidence in success

3. Gas Protection:
   - **Max Gas Price**: Upper limit for gas price
   - **Gas Price Strategy**: Fixed, dynamic, or escalating
   - **Gas Limit Buffer**: Extra gas allocation percentage

### Stop Conditions

Configure automatic stop conditions:

1. **Profit Stops**:
   - Stop if profit falls below threshold
   - Pause trading if success rate drops

2. **Network Conditions**:
   - Pause during extreme gas prices

## Troubleshooting Failed Trades

### Common Failure Patterns

1. Slippage Failures:
   - Price moved beyond tolerance
   - Insufficient liquidity at execution time
   - External price impact from other traders

2. Gas-Related Failures:
   - Gas price too low for inclusion
   - Gas limit too low for execution
   - Network congestion causing delays

3. MEV-Related Failures:
   - Front-running by other traders
   - Sandwich attacks
   - Flashbots bundle rejection

### Remediation Strategies

1. For Slippage Failures:
   - Increase slippage tolerance
   - Implement more accurate price impact models
   - Avoid thin liquidity pools

2. For Gas Failures:
   - Increase gas price competitiveness
   - Adjust gas limit calculations
   - Implement dynamic gas strategies

3. For MEV Failures:
   - Enhance Flashbots bundle strategy
   - Increase priority fee for critical transactions
   - Implement multi-block targeting

### Continuous Improvement

1. Track all failures in a systematic way:
   - Categorize by failure type
   - Identify patterns and common factors
   - Quantify financial impact

2. Regular review process:
   - Weekly review of failed trades
   - Parameter adjustment based on patterns
   - Strategy refinement based on results

3. A/B Testing:
