# Active Development Context

## Current Focus
- Implemented ML system interface for market analysis
- Added Windows-compatible signal handling
- Fixed async manager initialization issues

## Recent Changes
1. Created ML system module structure:
   - Added model_interface.py with MLSystem class
   - Implemented async initialization and cleanup
   - Added market data analysis capabilities
   - Added price validation functionality

2. Enhanced signal handling:
   - Added platform-specific signal handling for Windows
   - Improved cleanup process for signal handlers
   - Added proper error handling and logging

## Next Steps
1. Integrate ML system with market analyzer
2. Implement ML model caching
3. Add price validation to arbitrage execution
4. Test signal handling on Windows platform

## Known Issues
- Need to test ML system integration
- Need to verify signal handling on Windows
- Need to implement actual ML models

## Architecture Notes
- Using asyncio for all async operations
- Following resource management patterns
- Implementing proper error handling
- Using type hints throughout the codebase
