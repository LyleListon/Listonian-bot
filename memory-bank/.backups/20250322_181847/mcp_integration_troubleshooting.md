# MCP Integration Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Overloaded Error

**Error Message:**
```json
{"type":"error","error":{"details":null,"type":"overloaded_error","message":"Overloaded"}}
```

**Description:**  
The "Overloaded" error occurs when an MCP server (like Glama.ai) is receiving too many requests or its system resources are being exhausted. This can happen when:
- Too many concurrent requests are made to the server
- Requests are made too rapidly in succession
- The server has reached its computational resource limits
- Rate limits have been exceeded

**Solution Implemented:**  
We've addressed this issue by implementing a resilient batch file (`run_glama_enhanced_strategy.bat`) with the following features:

1. **Exponential Backoff with Jitter:**
   - Initial wait time of 5 seconds
   - Doubles wait time after each failure
   - Adds random jitter (0-5 seconds) to prevent synchronized retries

2. **Rate Limiting:**
   - Added configurable delays between requests (default: 1.5 seconds)
   - Limited concurrent requests to 2
   - Added sequential processing of token pairs rather than parallel processing

3. **Comprehensive Error Handling:**
   - Maximum retry count (5 attempts)
   - Detailed logging of all attempts and errors
   - Try-catch blocks to handle exceptions gracefully

4. **Resource Optimization:**
   - Added sleep intervals between operations
   - Random jitter to prevent the "thundering herd" problem
   - Increased delays for more intensive operations

**Example Usage:**  
```bash
# Run the enhanced strategy test with resilient error handling
run_glama_enhanced_strategy.bat
```

**For Future MCP Integrations:**  
When integrating additional MCP servers, implement these best practices:

1. Always include rate limiting mechanisms
2. Implement exponential backoff for retries
3. Add jitter to prevent retry storms
4. Use proper error handling and logging
5. Consider implementing circuit breakers for persistent failures
6. Monitor resource usage and adjust limits accordingly

## Additional MCP Troubleshooting

### Docker-based MCP Server Connection Issues

If you encounter connection issues with Docker-based MCP servers:

1. Verify Docker is running: `docker info`
2. Check container status: `docker ps`
3. View container logs: `docker logs <container-id>`
4. Ensure network access is properly configured
5. Verify API keys and credentials are correctly set

### API Key Authentication Issues

If authentication fails for MCP servers:

1. Verify the API key is correctly entered in the MCP settings file
2. Check that the API key has the required permissions
3. Ensure the API key has not expired
4. Test the API key with a simple curl command outside of the MCP context

### Memory and Resource Constraints

If MCP servers fail due to resource constraints:

1. Increase the resource allocation for Docker containers if applicable
2. Implement caching to reduce repeated API calls
3. Batch related requests together to reduce overhead
4. Schedule intensive operations during off-peak hours
