# System Patterns and Architecture

## Core Design Patterns

### Resource Management Pattern
1. Initialization
   - Async initialization with proper error handling
   - Resource acquisition in defined order
   - State validation before operations

2. Cleanup
   - Registered cleanup handlers
   - Reverse order cleanup
   - Platform-specific cleanup

### Signal Handling Pattern
1. Platform Detection
   - Windows-specific handling
   - Unix event loop integration
   - Fallback mechanisms

2. Handler Registration
   - Cleanup handler registration
   - Signal handler setup
   - Handler restoration

### Thread Safety Pattern
1. Lock Management
   - Async locks for critical sections
   - Resource access control
   - State protection

2. Atomic Operations
   - Thread-safe state changes
   - Resource cleanup
   - Handler management

### ML System Pattern
1. Data Analysis
   - Market data processing
   - Price validation
   - Anomaly detection

2. Model Management
   - Cache management
   - Resource cleanup
   - State maintenance

## Implementation Guidelines

### Error Handling
1. Context Preservation
   - Error details logging
   - State recovery
   - Resource cleanup

2. Recovery Mechanisms
   - Graceful degradation
   - State restoration
   - Resource reinitialization

### Resource Lifecycle
1. Initialization
   ```python
   async with lock:
       if not initialized:
           try:
               # Initialize resources
               initialized = True
           except Exception:
               # Cleanup and re-raise
   ```

2. Cleanup
   ```python
   async with lock:
       if initialized:
           try:
               # Cleanup resources
           finally:
               initialized = False
   ```

### Signal Management
1. Handler Setup
   ```python
   if platform == "win32":
       # Windows signal handling
   else:
       # Unix signal handling
   ```

2. Cleanup Process
   ```python
   # Restore original handlers
   for handler in handlers:
       restore_handler(handler)
   ```

## Architecture Evolution
