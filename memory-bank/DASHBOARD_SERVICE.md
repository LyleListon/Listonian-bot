## Current Status

We have implemented a robust service architecture with proper initialization order and process management. The key components are:

1. Service Manager
   - Enforces correct initialization order
   - Handles service dependencies
   - Provides health checks
   - Implements proper cleanup procedures

2. Connection Manager
   - Manages service connections
   - Handles connection retries
   - Monitors connection health
   - Implements graceful disconnection

3. Process Manager
   - Handles process lifecycle
   - Provides process isolation
   - Implements resource cleanup
   - Monitors process health

## Implementation Details

### Service Architecture
```mermaid
graph TD
    SM[Service Manager] --> MS[Memory Service]
    SM --> MetS[Metrics Service]
    SM --> SS[System Service]
    CM[Connection Manager] --> MS
    CM --> MetS
    CM --> SS
    PM[Process Manager] --> All[All Services]
```

### Initialization Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as App
    participant PM as Process Manager
    participant SM as Service Manager
    participant CM as Connection Manager
    participant S as Services

    A->>PM: Initialize
    PM->>PM: Clean Existing
    PM->>PM: Start Monitor
    PM-->>A: Ready
    A->>SM: Initialize
    SM->>S: Initialize Services
    S-->>SM: Services Ready
    SM-->>A: Manager Ready
    A->>CM: Initialize
    CM->>SM: Get Services
    SM-->>CM: Services
    CM->>CM: Start Tasks
    CM-->>A: Ready
```

### Process Management Flow
```mermaid

    Check[Check Running] --> Kill[Kill if Exists]
    Kill --> Wait[Wait for Cleanup]
    Wait --> Start[Start New Process]
    Start --> Monitor[Monitor Health]
```

## Key Features

1. Service Initialization
   - Memory service initializes first
   - Proper dependency resolution
   - Health checks during startup
   - Error recovery procedures
   - State validation

2. Connection Management
   - Automatic connection retries
   - Health monitoring
   - Graceful disconnection
   - Error handling with backoff

3. Process Management
   - Clean process termination
   - Resource cleanup between restarts
   - Process isolation
   - Health monitoring
   - Auto-recovery

4. Error Handling
   - Comprehensive error capture
   - Recovery procedures
   - Error reporting
   - Enhanced logging

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Service Management
   - Always initialize service manager first
   - Validate service state before use
   - Handle initialization errors gracefully
   - Maintain proper dependency order

2. Connection Handling
   - Implement connection retries
   - Monitor connection health
   - Handle disconnections gracefully
   - Maintain connection state

3. Process Management
   - Use targeted process termination
   - Ensure proper resource cleanup
   - Implement health monitoring
   - Handle process errors gracefully

4. Error Handling
   - Log all errors with context
   - Implement recovery procedures
   - Maintain system state
   - Provide error reporting
