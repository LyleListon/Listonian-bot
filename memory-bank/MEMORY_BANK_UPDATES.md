# Memory Bank Updates - March 18, 2025

## Test Suite Implementation and Cleanup

### Core Functionality Added
1. Web3 Interaction Layer (`arbitrage_bot/core/web3.py`):
   - Async contract interactions
   - Transaction building and handling
   - Gas estimation
   - Event filtering
   - Multicall support
   - Error handling

2. Storage Management (`arbitrage_bot/core/storage.py`):
   - Database connection pooling
   - Async resource management
   - Transaction handling
   - Query execution

3. Cache Management (`arbitrage_bot/core/cache.py`):
   - In-memory caching with TTL
   - Thread-safe operations
   - Async interface
   - Cleanup management

4. DEX Interface (`arbitrage_bot/core/dex.py`):
   - Base DEX implementation
   - SwapBased V3 integration
   - Price calculation
   - Liquidity validation
   - Pool data handling

### Implementation Details
- All components follow async/await patterns
- Thread safety with proper lock management
- Resource cleanup with context managers
- Standardized error handling
- Type hints throughout
- Comprehensive logging

### Technical Decisions
1. Web3 Manager:
   - Singleton pattern for provider management
   - Contract caching for performance
   - Automatic retry mechanisms
   - Checksummed address validation

2. Storage Layer:
   - Connection pooling for efficiency
   - Atomic operations support
   - Transaction isolation
   - Error context preservation

3. Cache System:
   - TTL-based invalidation
   - Memory usage monitoring
   - Background cleanup task
   - Thread-safe operations

4. DEX Integration:
   - Inheritance-based design
   - Version-specific implementations
   - Standard interface contract
   - Price impact analysis

### SwapBased V3 Integration Notes
1. Pool Data Retrieval:
   - Custom currentState() function
   - Different field names than standard V3
   - Case-insensitive address matching
   - Specific error handling

2. Price Calculation:
   - Q64.96 fixed-point handling
   - Decimal precision management
   - Token decimal adjustments
   - Slippage protection

### For Next Assistant
1. Core Functionality:
   - Web3, Storage, Cache, and DEX modules are production-ready
   - All components are async-first
   - Thread safety is implemented
   - Error handling is in place

2. Integration Points:
   - SwapBased V3 requires pool-specific handling
   - Token addresses must be checksummed
   - Use Web3Manager for contract interactions
   - Leverage cache for performance

3. Next Steps:
   - Implement Flashbots bundle submission
   - Add multi-path arbitrage optimization
   - Enhance price impact analysis
   - Implement profit validation

4. Testing Approach:
   - Core functionality is tested
   - Mock implementations are available
   - Integration tests cover key paths
   - Performance benchmarks established

Remember:
- All DEX interactions must be async
- Use proper error handling
- Maintain thread safety
- Follow resource management patterns
- Keep checksummed addresses
- Include slippage protection
