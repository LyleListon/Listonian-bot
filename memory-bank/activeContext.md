## Enhanced Price Discovery (via Alchemy)

### Real-time Price Updates
- WebSocket subscriptions for instant price changes
- Batched token price fetching
- Historical price data access
- Price impact analysis

### Gas Optimization
- Real-time gas price predictions
- Historical gas usage analysis
- Priority fee optimization
- Bundle gas estimation

### MEV Protection
- Enhanced mempool monitoring
- Transaction simulation
- Bundle optimization
- Front-running detection

## Profitability Calculation

Our arbitrage profitability is determined through a 3-stage process:

### 1. Initial Path Discovery
- Raw Profit = Final Amount - Initial Amount
- Profit Margin = (Final Amount / Initial Amount) - 1
- Must exceed $0.50 (0.00017 ETH at $3000/ETH)
- Base Gas Cost = 150,000 + (100,000 * number_of_steps)

### 2. Path Evaluation
- Verify sufficient liquidity in all pools
- Calculate cumulative price impact
- Execution Probability = 1 - (total_price_impact / path_length)
- Expected Net Profit = Raw Profit * Execution Probability

### 3. Bundle Optimization
- Total Gas Cost = gas_used * gas_price
- Final Net Profit = Expected Profit - Total Gas Cost
- Gas cost must not exceed 10% of expected profit
- Gas price adjusted based on MEV risk level
- Priority fees scale with risk (1.5-3.0 gwei)

print(f"Detection Accuracy: {metrics['accuracy_metrics']['overall_accuracy']}")
print(f"Gas Saved: {metrics['gas_metrics']['total_gas_saved']}")
print(f"Protected Value: {metrics['profit_metrics']['protected_value_usd']}")
```
