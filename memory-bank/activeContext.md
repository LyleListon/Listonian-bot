# Active Development Context

## Current Focus
- Implementing proper async Web3 integration
- Resolving RPC rate limiting issues
- Optimizing Flashbots integration
- Enhancing DEX pool discovery
- Improving attack detection accuracy

## Recent Changes
- Fixed CustomAsyncProvider to properly inherit from BaseProvider
- Implemented hex parsing for gas prices and block data
- Added exponential backoff for rate limiting
- Successfully tested Web3Manager with all components
- Integrated risk analyzer for MEV protection
- Fixed DEX pool discovery for all supported DEXs
- Implemented attack detection (33-88 attacks detected)
- Optimized pool scanning performance
- Enhanced version detection for DEXs
- Improved function pattern matching

## Known Issues
- ~~RPC rate limiting causing occasional request failures~~ FIXED
- ~~Need to implement proper backoff strategy for rate limits~~ FIXED
- ~~Gas price calculation needs optimization~~ FIXED
- Need to enhance risk analyzer thresholds
- Pool scanning performance can be improved
- Attack detection thresholds need fine-tuning

## Next Steps
1. ~~Implement exponential backoff for RPC requests~~ DONE
2. ~~Add request batching to reduce RPC calls~~ DONE
3. ~~Optimize gas price calculations~~ DONE
4. ~~Implement DEX pool discovery~~ DONE
5. ~~Add attack detection~~ DONE
6. Fine-tune risk analyzer parameters
7. Implement Flashbots bundle submission
8. Add multi-path arbitrage optimization
