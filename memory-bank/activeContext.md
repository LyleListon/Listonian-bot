# Active Development Context

## Current Focus
- Implementing proper async/await patterns throughout the system
- Fixing initialization sequence for Web3Manager and related components
- Ensuring proper event loop handling in async operations

## Recent Changes
1. Fixed Web3Manager initialization:
   - Moved provider setup to initialize() method
   - Added proper async handling for chain_id verification
   - Added to_wei and from_wei utility methods
   - Improved error handling and logging

2. Fixed WalletManager initialization:
   - Moved wallet address setup to initialize() method
   - Improved async operation handling
   - Added proper error handling for wallet operations

3. Fixed async provider implementation:
   - Improved event loop handling in CustomAsyncProvider
   - Added proper cleanup for event loops
   - Fixed synchronous operation wrapping

## Current Issues
1. Event loop management:
   - Need to ensure proper event loop handling across all async operations
   - Need to prevent event loop conflicts in nested async calls

2. Initialization sequence:
   - Components need to be initialized in the correct order
   - Need to ensure all async operations are properly awaited

## Next Steps
1. Test the full initialization sequence
2. Verify proper event loop handling under load
3. Implement proper error recovery mechanisms
4. Add comprehensive logging for async operations

## Critical Components
1. Web3Manager
   - Handles all Web3 interactions
   - Manages providers and connections
   - Provides utility methods for Wei conversion

2. WalletManager
   - Manages wallet operations
   - Handles balance maintenance
   - Executes token swaps

3. FlashbotsProvider
   - Handles MEV protection
   - Manages bundle submissions
   - Provides transaction simulation

## Architecture Notes
- All components must follow async/await patterns
- Event loops must be properly managed
- Error handling must preserve context
- Resource cleanup must be thorough

## Performance Considerations
- Minimize synchronous operations
- Use proper caching strategies
- Implement efficient batch operations
- Monitor resource usage

## Security Notes
- Validate all inputs
- Protect private keys
- Monitor for suspicious activities
- Implement proper access controls
