# Active Development Context

## Current Status (Updated 2025-03-13)

### Active Components
1. Web3 Client
   - Fully async implementation
   - Direct RPC calls
   - Resource management
   - Error handling and retries
   - Base mainnet connection

2. Dashboard
   - FastAPI-based monitoring
   - Blockchain status tracking
   - Resource management
   - Error handling

### Working Environment
- Python 3.12+
- FastAPI framework
- Uvicorn ASGI server
- Web3.py with async support
- Base mainnet RPC endpoint

### Active Priorities
1. Monitoring and Metrics
   - Block processing
   - Gas prices
   - Connection health
   - Error rates

2. Resource Management
   - Async context handling
   - Proper cleanup
   - Thread safety
   - Connection pooling

3. Error Handling
   - Retry mechanisms
   - Timeout handling
   - Error reporting
   - Recovery procedures

### Current Focus
- Stabilizing blockchain connectivity
- Improving async performance
- Enhancing monitoring capabilities
- Optimizing resource usage

### Integration Points
- Base mainnet RPC
- Production config system
- Logging infrastructure
- Error handling framework

### Known Issues
None currently - Web3 client and dashboard are functioning as expected:
- Successfully connecting to Base mainnet
- Retrieving block information
- Monitoring gas prices
- Managing resources properly

### Next Actions
1. Implement metrics collection
2. Add performance monitoring
3. Consider WebSocket support
4. Add historical data tracking

### Dependencies
- Web3.py async components
- FastAPI framework
- Uvicorn server
- Logging system
- Configuration management

### Active Development Areas
- Metrics collection
- Performance monitoring
- Resource optimization
- Error handling improvements

This context represents the current state of development after implementing the Web3 client improvements and dashboard functionality. The system is now properly connecting to Base mainnet and providing blockchain status information through a well-structured API.
