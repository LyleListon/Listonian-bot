# Active Development Context

## Current Focus
- Implementing Flashbots integration for MEV protection
- Setting up flash loan functionality through Balancer
- Configuring production environment
- Debugging Web3Manager middleware integration

## Recent Changes
1. Generated new Flashbots authentication key:
   - Address: 0xe8F1Fb45ccfd9647e29D12AB0f4EE2584078c3CB
   - Private Key: Added to configs/production.json

2. Updated configuration:
   - Fixed Flashbots relay URL to https://relay.flashbots.net
   - Added Flashbots auth key to config
   - Configured Balancer vault address

3. Fixed Web3Manager Implementation:
   - Created proper SignerMiddleware class
   - Implemented make_request method
   - Updated middleware registration
   - Fixed transaction signing logic

4. Updated RiskAnalyzer:
   - Removed direct w3 access
   - Using Web3Manager interface
   - Improved error handling
   - Added proper middleware support

5. Current Issues:
   - Config loader needs updating to properly handle production.json
   - Current validation doesn't match production config structure
   - Default config path points to wrong file
   - Web3Manager middleware needs further debugging
   - SignerMiddleware integration needs testing

## Next Steps
1. Debug Web3Manager middleware:
   - Fix SignerMiddleware implementation
   - Test transaction signing
   - Verify proper middleware registration
   - Ensure correct error handling

2. Update config_loader.py to:
   - Set DEFAULT_CONFIG_PATH to "configs/production.json"
   - Update validation for production config structure
   - Add proper error handling for Flashbots config

3. Test configuration loading:
   - Verify Flashbots auth key is properly loaded
   - Ensure all required sections are validated
   - Check proper error messages for missing fields

4. Continue with Flashbots integration:
   - Test bundle submission
   - Implement profit calculation
   - Add MEV protection

## Current Blockers
- Config loader needs updating to properly handle production configuration
- Web3Manager middleware integration with Flashbots needs fixing
- Need to verify transaction signing with new middleware implementation

## Technical Debt
- Config loader needs refactoring to handle multiple config file formats
- Better error messages needed for config validation
- Consider adding config schema validation
- Add comprehensive tests for Web3Manager middleware
