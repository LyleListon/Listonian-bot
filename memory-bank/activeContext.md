# Active Development Context

## Current Focus
- Implementing proper web3 contract handling and async patterns
- Fixing property access and coroutine-related issues
- Improving error handling and type safety

## Recent Changes

### Web3 Contract Handling Improvements (3/10/2025)
1. Fixed Web3Manager implementation:
   - Changed eth from property to instance variable
   - Initialized eth in constructor
   - Added proper error handling
   - Added better type hints

2. Fixed contract handling:
   - Added proper contract creation method
   - Added proper contract wrapping
   - Added proper async/await handling
   - Added better type hints

3. Fixed Web3ClientWrapper:
   - Added proper eth module handling
   - Added proper contract creation method
   - Added proper error handling
   - Added better type hints

### Next Steps
1. Test contract interactions across all DEXs
2. Verify async/await patterns in flash loan execution
3. Implement additional error handling for edge cases
4. Add performance monitoring for contract calls

## Current Challenges
- Ensuring proper async/await patterns across all contract interactions
- Maintaining type safety with web3.py integration
- Handling edge cases in contract function calls

## Active Tasks
1. Complete Flashbots integration testing
2. Optimize flash loan execution
3. Enhance MEV protection mechanisms
4. Test multi-path arbitrage optimization

## Recent Decisions
1. Changed eth handling from property to instance variable for better control
2. Implemented proper contract wrapping for async support
3. Added comprehensive error handling for contract interactions
4. Improved type hints for better code safety

## Notes
- All contract interactions must follow async/await patterns
- Error handling should preserve context
- Type hints should be comprehensive
- Performance monitoring is critical
