# Active Development Context

## CRITICAL PRIORITY
Immediate focus is on deploying the bot and dashboard with LIVE DATA ONLY:
- Remove all mock/fake/placeholder/simulated data
- Use only real blockchain data
- Connect to actual DEX contracts
- Live price feeds only
- Real-time monitoring

## Current Focus
1. Production Deployment
   - Live blockchain integration
   - Real DEX connections
   - Actual token contracts
   - Live price data

2. Dashboard Deployment
   - Real-time data display
   - Live transaction monitoring
   - Actual profit tracking
   - Real pool statistics

3. Data Sources
   - Direct blockchain queries
   - Live DEX contract calls
   - Real-time price feeds
   - Actual pool states

## Recent Changes
1. Updated web3_manager.py for live blockchain interaction
2. Enhanced dex_manager.py to handle real DEX contracts
3. Improved path_finder.py for actual pool discovery
4. Removed all test/mock data

## Current Challenges
- Ensuring reliable live data feeds
- Handling real-time contract interactions
- Managing production environment
- Monitoring live transactions

## Next Steps
1. Complete live data integration
2. Deploy production environment
3. Launch real-time monitoring
4. Enable live trading

## Open Questions
- Production deployment strategy?
- Live monitoring approach?
- Error handling in production?
- Recovery procedures?

## Technical Debt
- Remove remaining test data
- Enhance error handling
- Improve logging
- Optimize performance

## Security Considerations
- Live transaction validation
- Real-time balance checks
- Production security measures
- Live monitoring alerts
