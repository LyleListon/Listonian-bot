# BaseSwap V3 Integration Debug Status

## Current State
- Updated BaseSwap V3 contract addresses from official docs
- Testing contract interactions with correct V3 addresses

## Contract Addresses (From BaseSwap Docs)
Factory: 0x38015D05f4fEC8AFe15D7cc0386a126574e8077B
Router: 0x1B8eea9315bE495187D873DA7773a874545D9D48
Quoter: 0x0C1Ef7cA95C6C2CeF48eDFc51CE1BeB2Aa2D8410

## Investigation Progress

1. Initial Problem:
   - Web3 calls to getPool function returning '0x' (no contract code)
   - Found we were using wrong factory address

2. First Fix Attempt:
   - Updated to what we thought was V3 factory
   - Function calls reverted with "execution reverted" error
   - Error occurred for all fee tiers (100, 500, 3000)

3. Current Fix:
   - Found correct V3 addresses in BaseSwap docs
   - Previous factory was likely a V2 contract (based on PancakeSwap-like bytecode)
   - Updated config.json with correct V3 factory and router addresses

## Files Modified
1. config.json - Updated BaseSwap V3 factory and router addresses to correct V3 contracts

## Next Steps
1. Test pool queries with correct V3 factory
2. Verify if we need to update ABI for V3 interface
3. Monitor for any new errors

## Notes for Next Assistant
- Previous addresses were incorrect (likely V2 contracts)
- New addresses verified from official BaseSwap documentation
- Factory: 0x38015D05f4fEC8AFe15D7cc0386a126574e8077B
- Router: 0x1B8eea9315bE495187D873DA7773a874545D9D48
