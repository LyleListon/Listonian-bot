# Dashboard WebSocket Status and Next Steps

## Current Status
- Basic WebSocket functionality is working with real-time updates
- Successfully implemented context manager pattern for connection management
- System metrics are displaying correctly (CPU, Memory usage)
- Favicon handling is working properly with 204 response

## Remaining Issues
- WebSocket cleanup during disconnection still shows errors
- Tasks are not being properly cancelled before connection closure
- Multiple error messages about sending after close

## Next Steps

### 1. WebSocket Connection Management
- Implement proper state tracking for WebSocket connections
- Add explicit state checks before sending messages
- Ensure tasks are cancelled before connection cleanup

### 2. Task Management
- Add task synchronization mechanism
- Implement proper task cancellation order
- Add timeout handling for task cleanup

### 3. Error Handling
- Add better error handling for disconnection scenarios
- Implement graceful shutdown for WebSocket connections
- Add retry mechanism for failed connections

### 4. Code Changes Needed
```python
# Key areas to modify:

# 1. Connection state tracking
self._connections[websocket] = {
    "active": True,
    "state": "connected",  # Add explicit state tracking
    "tasks": set(),
    "queues": set()
}

# 2. Task cancellation
async def _cancel_tasks(self, websocket):
    """Cancel tasks in correct order."""
    if websocket in self._connections:
        self._connections[websocket]["state"] = "disconnecting"
        tasks = list(self._connections[websocket]["tasks"])
        for task in tasks:
            if not task.done():
                task.cancel()
        await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)

# 3. Message sending with state check
async def send_message(self, websocket, message):
    """Send message with state verification."""
    if (websocket in self._connections and 
        self._connections[websocket]["state"] == "connected"):
        await websocket.send_json(message)
```

### 5. Testing Scenarios
- Test normal disconnection flow
- Test abrupt connection termination
- Test concurrent connections/disconnections
- Verify task cleanup
- Monitor memory usage during connection cycling

## Implementation Priority
1. Fix task cancellation in disconnect method
2. Add proper state tracking
3. Implement safe message sending
4. Add comprehensive error handling
5. Add connection lifecycle logging

## Notes for Next Developer
- The current implementation uses asyncio and FastAPI
- WebSocket connections are managed through a ConnectionManager class
- Context managers are used for resource cleanup
- Key files to focus on:
  - new_dashboard/dashboard/routes/websocket.py
  - new_dashboard/dashboard/services/metrics_service.py
  - new_dashboard/dashboard/services/memory_service.py

## Related Files
- new_dashboard/dashboard/routes/websocket.py
- new_dashboard/dashboard/app.py
- new_dashboard/dashboard/services/service_manager.py
- new_dashboard/dashboard/core/logging.py

## Current Metrics
- CPU Usage: ~14.8%
- Memory Usage: ~27.4%
- WebSocket Connection Status: Working with cleanup issues
- Real-time Updates: Functioning correctly until disconnect

## Testing Instructions
1. Start dashboard: `python -m new_dashboard.run_dashboard`
2. Connect to WebSocket endpoint: `ws://localhost:9050/ws/metrics`
3. Monitor console for error messages
4. Test disconnection handling
5. Verify task cleanup
