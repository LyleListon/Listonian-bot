## User Stories

### Arbitrage Execution
```gherkin
Feature: Execute arbitrage opportunity
  As a system operator
  I want to execute profitable arbitrage trades
  So that I can generate consistent profits

  Scenario: Execute profitable trade
    Given a profitable arbitrage opportunity exists
    When the system discovers the opportunity
    Then it should validate the profit
    And execute the trade through flash loans
    And protect against MEV attacks
    And verify the execution success
```

### Contract Interaction
```gherkin
Feature: Interact with smart contracts
  As the arbitrage system
  I want to interact with DEX contracts
  So that I can execute trades efficiently

  Scenario: Get pool information
    Given a DEX pool exists
    When the system queries the pool
    Then it should receive pool data
    And handle the response asynchronously
    And manage resources properly
    And handle errors appropriately
```
