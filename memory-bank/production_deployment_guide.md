### 1.3 Starting the System

1. **Start the arbitrage system**:
   ```
   .\start_production.bat
   ```
   This will run the system in production mode, starting to scan for arbitrage opportunities.

2. **Start the monitoring dashboard**:
   ```
   .\start_new_dashboard.bat
   ```
   The dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:8080` by default.

### 1.4 Security Considerations

1. **Secure Private Keys**:

   - Never commit private keys to version control
   - Consider using hardware wallets for production deployments

2. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Set reasonable limits for RPC calls to avoid API throttling
   - Use multiple providers for redundancy

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Monitor error logs regularly
   - Set up alerts for critical failures
