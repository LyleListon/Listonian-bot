## Team Notes

### Key Decisions
1. Changed eth handling from property to instance variable
2. Implemented proper contract wrapping
3. Added comprehensive error handling
4. Improved type hints

### Lessons Learned
1. Property setters should be avoided for core modules
2. Contract interactions must be properly wrapped
3. Error context must be preserved
4. Type safety is critical

### Best Practices
1. Always use async/await for contract calls
2. Always handle errors with proper context
3. Always use proper resource management
4. Always validate inputs and outputs
