## Current Status
### Ready for Use
- Web3 Manager (contract interactions, transactions)
- Storage Layer (database connections, pooling)
- Cache System (TTL-based, thread-safe)
- Base DEX Implementation (standard interface)

### In Progress
- SwapBased V3 Integration (pool data, price calc)
- Flashbots Integration (planning phase)
- Multi-path Arbitrage (design phase)

### Not Started
- Bundle Submission
- MEV Protection
- Flash Loan Integration
- Profit Optimization

## Technical Achievements
1. Architecture
   - Pure async/await implementation
   - Thread-safe operations
   - Resource management patterns
   - Error handling system

2. Performance
   - Connection pooling
   - Cache implementation
   - Batch operations support
   - Resource efficiency

3. Security
   - Address validation
   - Slippage protection
   - Transaction validation
   - Error boundaries

## Challenges Overcome
1. SwapBased V3 Integration
   - Different function names
   - Custom state handling
   - Case-sensitive addresses
   - Pool-specific logic

2. Testing Infrastructure
   - Mock implementations
   - Async testing patterns
   - Resource cleanup
   - Coverage tracking

## Next Priorities
1. Immediate Focus
   - Complete SwapBased V3 integration
   - Start Flashbots integration
   - Design multi-path arbitrage
   - Implement profit validation

2. Short-term Goals
   - Bundle submission system
   - MEV protection layer
   - Flash loan integration
   - Price impact analysis

3. Medium-term Goals
   - Multi-DEX arbitrage
   - Advanced profit optimization
   - Risk management system
   - Performance monitoring

## Resource Allocation
1. Development Focus
   - 40% Flashbots integration
   - 30% SwapBased V3 completion
   - 20% Multi-path arbitrage
   - 10% System maintenance

2. Technical Debt
   - None (recently cleaned)
   - Core systems tested
   - Documentation updated
   - Tests removed

## Success Metrics
