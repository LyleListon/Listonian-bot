# Development Progress

## 2025-03-13: Enhanced Dashboard Implementation

### Completed Tasks

1. Web3 Client Improvements
   - Implemented pure async/await pattern
   - Added direct RPC calls for better performance
   - Implemented proper resource management
   - Added robust error handling and retries
   - Added detailed logging system
   - Fixed PoA chain handling for Base mainnet

2. Basic Dashboard Development
   - Created proper Python package structure
   - Implemented FastAPI endpoints
   - Added blockchain status monitoring
   - Implemented proper error handling
   - Added resource cleanup on shutdown

3. Enhanced Dashboard Features
   - Added WebSocket support for real-time updates
   - Implemented live metric streaming
   - Added real-time alerts system
   - Enhanced UI with dynamic updates
   - Added comprehensive monitoring:
     * Arbitrage performance tracking
     * Flash loan metrics
     * MEV protection statistics
     * Gas optimization metrics
     * Profit analysis

### Verification
- Successfully connected to Base mainnet
- Confirmed block retrieval (latest: 27530319)
- Verified gas price monitoring (0.007 gwei)
- Tested error handling and retries
- Validated resource cleanup
- Confirmed real-time updates working

### Technical Debt Addressed
- Removed dependency on problematic middleware
- Improved async/await implementation
- Added proper resource management
- Enhanced error handling
- Added comprehensive logging
- Implemented WebSocket communication

### Next Steps
1. Add metrics collection
   - Block processing time
   - Gas price trends
   - RPC call latency

2. Implement monitoring
   - Connection health
   - Error rates
   - Resource usage

3. Dashboard Enhancements
   - Add historical data visualization
   - Implement advanced analytics
   - Add custom alert configurations
   - Performance analytics

### Challenges Faced
- Middleware compatibility issues with async operations
- Resource management in async context
- Error handling across async boundaries
- Proper initialization sequencing
- Real-time data synchronization

### Solutions Implemented
- Direct RPC calls instead of middleware
- Async context managers for resources
- Comprehensive error handling system
- Initialization locks and retries
- WebSocket-based real-time updates

### Impact
- More reliable blockchain connectivity
- Better async performance
- Improved error recovery
- Enhanced monitoring capabilities
- Better resource management
- Real-time system visibility
- Improved operational awareness
