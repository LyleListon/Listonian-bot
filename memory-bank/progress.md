# Progress Log

## Flashbots Integration Progress (2025-03-10)

### Actions Completed
- Generated new Flashbots authentication key
- Updated production configuration:
  - Added Flashbots auth key
  - Fixed relay URL to https://relay.flashbots.net
  - Configured Balancer vault address
- Created flash loan module:
  - Implemented BalancerFlashLoan class
  - Added flash loan transaction building
  - Integrated with Flashbots bundles
- Fixed Web3Manager middleware:
  - Created SignerMiddleware class
  - Implemented make_request method
  - Updated transaction signing logic
  - Fixed middleware initialization
- Updated RiskAnalyzer:
  - Fixed Web3Manager interface usage
  - Removed direct w3 access
  - Improved error handling
  - Added proper middleware support

### Current Status
- Base mainnet connection working
- DEX manager initialized with 3 DEXs:
  - Aerodrome
  - BaseSwap
  - SwapBased
- PathFinder initialized with max path length 4
- Flash loan module ready for testing
- Web3Manager middleware updated but needs debugging
- RiskAnalyzer using proper Web3Manager interface

### Technical Notes
- Flashbots Authentication:
  - Address: 0xe8F1Fb45ccfd9647e29D12AB0f4EE2584078c3CB
  - Private Key: Stored in production.json
  - No funds needed for this address
  - Used only for bundle signing
- Web3Manager Middleware:
  - Class-based implementation
  - make_request method for transaction handling
  - Proper middleware registration
  - Transaction signing support
  - Currently debugging integration issues
- RiskAnalyzer Updates:
  - Uses Web3Manager methods directly
  - Proper error propagation
  - Improved transaction handling
  - Better gas price monitoring

### Current Challenges
1. Web3Manager Middleware:
   - SignerMiddleware integration issues
   - Transaction signing needs testing
   - Middleware registration debugging needed
   - Error handling improvements required

2. Configuration Loading:
   - Config loader using wrong default path
   - Validation not matching production config structure
   - Flashbots auth key not being recognized

3. Integration Points:
   - Flash loan transaction building needs testing
   - Bundle simulation needs implementation
   - Profit calculation needs validation
   - Web3Manager middleware needs integration testing

### Next Steps
1. Debug Web3Manager Changes:
   - Fix SignerMiddleware implementation
   - Test transaction signing
   - Verify middleware registration
   - Add integration tests

2. Update config_loader.py:
   - Fix default config path
   - Update validation logic
   - Add proper error handling

3. Test Components:
   - Flash loan execution
   - Bundle submission
   - MEV protection

4. Implement Monitoring:
   - Add profit tracking
   - Monitor gas usage
   - Track execution success rate

### Dependencies
- Python 3.12+ for async support
- Web3.py for blockchain interaction
- Eth-account for key management
- PyCryptodome for hashing (replacing pysha3)

### System Architecture
- Pure asyncio implementation
- Thread-safe operations
- Proper error handling
- Resource management
- Comprehensive logging

Remember: Focus on fixing the Web3Manager middleware integration before proceeding with other tasks. The middleware is a critical component for transaction signing and Flashbots integration.
