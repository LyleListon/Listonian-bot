# Listonian Arbitrage Bot - Project Brief

## Mission Statement

To create a sophisticated, profit-maximizing arbitrage system that identifies and capitalizes on price discrepancies across decentralized exchanges with unmatched efficiency, security, and reliability.

## Core Objectives

1. **Maximize Profit**
   - Identify and execute profitable arbitrage opportunities across multiple DEXs
   - Optimize capital allocation for highest returns
   - Minimize costs through gas optimization and efficient execution

2. **Ensure Security**
   - Protect against MEV attacks (front-running, sandwich attacks)
   - Implement robust validation for all transactions
   - Verify profits before execution to prevent losses

3. **Achieve Reliability**
   - Create a system that operates continuously with minimal downtime
   - Implement comprehensive error handling and recovery
   - Ensure accurate execution of arbitrage strategies

4. **Scale Effectively**
   - Support multiple chains and DEXs through modular design
   - Handle increasing transaction volumes and market complexity
   - Efficiently allocate resources based on opportunity size

   - Standardizes interfaces for DEX interactions
   - Manages DEX-specific quirks and optimizations

## Success Criteria

The project will be considered successful when it:

1. Consistently identifies and executes profitable arbitrage opportunities
2. Securely manages capital with no losses due to system errors
3. Maintains reliable operation over extended periods
4. Achieves a positive ROI accounting for all development and operational costs
5. Scales effectively as market conditions and opportunities evolve
