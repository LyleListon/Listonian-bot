# Project Brief

## Overview
Listonian-bot is a high-performance arbitrage bot designed to execute profitable trades across multiple DEXs using flash loans and Flashbots protection. The system focuses on maximizing profits while ensuring secure and efficient execution.

## Core Objectives
1. Execute profitable arbitrage trades
2. Protect against MEV attacks
3. Optimize gas usage and execution speed
4. Ensure transaction security and reliability
5. Maximize capital efficiency through flash loans

## Technical Architecture
- Python 3.12+ based implementation
- Pure asyncio for asynchronous operations
- Thread-safe design with proper locking
- Modular DEX integration system
- Comprehensive testing suite
- Real-time monitoring and alerts

## Key Components
1. Arbitrage Core
   - Path finding algorithms
   - Profit calculation
   - Transaction building
   - Execution management

2. DEX Integration
   - Standardized interfaces
   - Version-specific implementations
   - Price monitoring
   - Liquidity analysis

3. Flash Loan System
   - Multiple provider support
   - Balance verification
   - Atomic execution
   - Profit validation

4. Flashbots Integration
   - RPC connection
   - Bundle submission
   - MEV protection
   - Transaction privacy

5. Monitoring System
   - Real-time metrics
   - Error tracking
   - Performance monitoring
   - Profit analysis

## Repository Structure
