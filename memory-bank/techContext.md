# Technical Context

## Web3 Client Implementation (Updated 2025-03-13)

The Web3 client has been updated to use pure async/await patterns with direct RPC calls:

- Uses AsyncWeb3 with AsyncHTTPProvider for better async support
- Implements proper resource management with initialization locks
- Handles PoA chains through direct RPC calls instead of middleware
- Includes robust error handling and retry mechanisms
- Features detailed logging for debugging and monitoring

Key improvements:
- Async initialization with timeout and retries
- Thread-safe operations with locks
- Resource cleanup on shutdown
- Direct RPC calls for better performance
- Standardized error handling

## Dashboard Implementation (Added 2025-03-13)

A new FastAPI-based dashboard has been implemented for monitoring blockchain status:

### Architecture
- Proper Python package structure
- FastAPI for async API endpoints
- Uvicorn for ASGI server
- Organized module hierarchy

### Features
- Root endpoint with API documentation
- Status endpoint showing:
  - Connection status
  - Latest block number
  - Current gas price
  - Chain information
- Proper error handling and status codes
- Resource management for Web3 client

### Endpoints
- `/` - API documentation and endpoint listing
- `/status` - Blockchain connection status

### Error Handling
- Initialization errors with retries
- Timeout handling for RPC calls
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Detailed error messages

## Current Technical Stack

- Python 3.12+ for async support
- FastAPI for web framework
- Web3.py with async support
- Uvicorn for ASGI server
- AsyncHTTPProvider for RPC calls

## Integration Points

The Web3 client and dashboard are integrated with:
- Base mainnet RPC endpoint
- Production configuration system
- Logging infrastructure
- Error handling framework

## Next Steps

1. Add metrics collection for:
   - Block processing time
   - Gas price trends
   - RPC call latency

2. Implement monitoring for:
   - Connection health
   - Error rates
   - Resource usage

3. Consider adding:
   - WebSocket support for real-time updates
   - Historical data tracking
   - Performance analytics
