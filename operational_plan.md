# Operational Plan for Listonian-bot

This document outlines the steps required to get the Listonian-bot operational.

## Prerequisites

*   Python 3.x
*   Node.js
*   Git
*   Environment variables:
    *   `PRIVATE_KEY`: Your private key for the Base network.
    *   `BASE_RPC_URL`: The RPC URL for the Base network.

## Setup

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```

2.  Create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
    ```

3.  Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    ```

4.  Configure the bot:

    *   Copy `docs/reference/configuration.md` to `system.conf`:

        ```bash
        ```

    *   Update `configs/config.json` with your actual values:
        *   Set `wallet.private_key` to your private key.
        *   Verify `network.rpc_url` is correct.
        *   Configure the DEXes you want to use.
        *   Configure the tokens you want to trade.
        *   Adjust the arbitrage settings as needed.
        *   Adjust the monitoring settings as needed.
        *   Adjust the gas settings as needed.
        *   Adjust the process settings as needed.
        *   Adjust the optimization settings as needed.

## Running the Bot

1.  Start the dashboard:

    ```bash
    .\start_dashboard.bat # or start_dashboard.sh or start_dashboard.ps1
    ```

2.  Start the bot:

    ```bash
    .\start_bot.bat # or start_bot.sh or start_bot.ps1
    ```

## Troubleshooting

*   If you encounter errors, check the logs in the `logs/instances` directory.
*   Verify that your environment variables are set correctly.
*   Verify that your configuration settings are correct.
*   Make sure you have enough gas to execute trades.
*   Make sure the DEXes you are using have enough liquidity.

## Next Steps

*   Monitor the bot's performance and adjust the configuration settings as needed.
*   Implement advanced features, such as an event system and enhanced monitoring.
*   Improve the code quality and reduce technical debt.
