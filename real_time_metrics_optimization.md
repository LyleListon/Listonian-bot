# Real-Time Metrics Optimization Plan

## Current Performance
- Memory Service: 5-second updates with file I/O bottleneck (~100-200ms per read)
- Metrics Service: 5-second polling with synchronous processing (~50-100ms)
- Total latency: 5-6 seconds for updates

## Target Performance
- Memory Service: Near real-time updates (<50ms) using memory mapping
- Metrics Service: Continuous WebSocket streaming (<10ms)
- Total latency: 50-100ms for updates
- Resource usage: 90% reduction in CPU usage, 75% reduction in memory usage
